VFirst used in ancient India by Aryans, it was used to divide society into separate groups called castes. These castes are, in order from top to bottom: Brahmins (priest class, considered closest to the gods), warriors, landowners, and peasants. Below these castes were the "untouchables", or outcasts. Movement between castes was allowed in the early days of the system, but over time mobility became restricted and you could only rise between castes when you died and were reincarnated.

sVThis is a circular motion problem. There is a swing with a central shaft, and rod, with a rope attached to that. You are given a rod distance, a rope distance and an angle (theta) as the rope swings in a circle. You must draw the free body diagram, find the time of one revolution given the angle, and answer if the angle depends on the weight of the passenger.
p4021
VFirst find the total radius with trig. \u000a\u000aYour free body diagram has one downward force (force of gravity, mg), and the tension is split into one upward Ty and one inward Tx. You set the upward Ty equal to the downward force of gravity and solve for T. Then you plug that into the inward Tx definition. That is the force causing movement, or F=ma. So You can solve for acceleration by setting the inward force equal to mass times acceleration. \u000a\u000aThen you can solve for velocity using your acceleration in the circular acceleration formula. \u000a\u000aThen you plug velocity and radius into the revolution formula to find how much time it takes for one revolution to go around. \u000a\u000aThe mass cancels out when you do the problem. \u000a\u000a(You must find the value of sin(30).

sVInstrument resolution (random)
p5147
VAll instruments have finite precision that limits the ability to resolve small measurement differences. For instance, a meter stick cannot distinguish distances to a precision much better than about half of its smallest scale division (0.5 mm in this case). One of the best ways to obtain more precise measurements is to use a null difference method instead of measuring a quantity directly. Null or balance methods involve using instrumentation to measure the difference between two similar quantities, one of which is known very accurately and is adjustable. The adjustable reference quantity is varied until the difference is reduced to zero. The two quantities are then balanced and the magnitude of the unknown quantity can be found by comparison with the reference sample. With this method, problems of source instability are eliminated, and the measuring instrument can be very sensitive and does not even need a scale.

V\u2023 Representation of the States: The Connecticut Compromise was devised as a solution to whether states should be equally represented in the new Congress (New Jersey Plan) or whether state representation in Congress should be based off of population (Virginia Plan). The Connecticut Compromise incorporates both, with Congress split into two houses - the House of Representatives (Virginia Plan) and the Senate (New Jersey Plan).\u000a\u2023 Slavery: Regarding representation in the House, Southerners wanted to count slaves as part of the population to increase their representation, but were reluctant to count slaves when it came to the state's apportionment of taxes. To solve this, Representation in the House and taxation was based on the three-fifths compromise, which stated that every slave was to be counted as three-fifths of a person when it came to population.\u000a\u2023 Equality in Voting: The rules on voting were left to the states, for fear that another rebellion would come about.

p8865
VYou set up a formula for the force of gravity for part 1. This would be the mass of C on the mass of A. You convert the AC distance in centimeters to meters. You plug it in with your gravitational constant (G = 6.67e-11) and your constant mass of each sphere in kilograms and divide by the converted meter value squared. \u000a\u000aThen you do the same exact thing for the force of gravity formula for part 2.

p8907
VGravitational potential energy is energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field. The most common use of gravitational potential energy is for an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant at about 9.8 m/s2. Since the zero of gravitational potential energy can be chosen at any point (like the choice of the zero of a coordinate system), the potential energy at a height h above that point is equal to the work which would be required to lift the object to that height with no net change in kinetic energy. It is negative.

p10429
V-an object in free-fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible.\u000a-on earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration due to gravity, which averages \u000ag = 9.80 m/s^2\u000a- whether the acceleration should be taken as +g or -g is determined by your choice of coordinate system. If you choose the upward direction as positive, a = -g = -9.8 m/s^2 is negative. In the oppisite case, a = +g = 9.8 m/s^2 is positive. Since acceleration is constant, the kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate +g or -g substituted for a.\u000a-For objects in free-fall, up is normally taken as positive for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

p12659
VIt is a weight suspended from a pivot so that it can swing freely. When a pendulum is displaced sideways from its resting, equilibrium position, it is subject to a restoring force due to gravity that will accelerate it back toward the equilibrium position. When released, the restoring force combined with the pendulum's mass causes it to oscillate about the equilibrium position, swinging back and forth. The time for one complete cycle, a left swing and a right swing, is called the period. The period depends on the length of the pendulum and also to a slight degree on the amplitude, the width of the pendulum's swing.

p15471
V-when objects rest on a surface, the surface applies a force to the object that supports the weight of the object. This supporting force acts perpendicular to and away from the surface. It is called normal force.\u000a-when objects rest on a non-accelerating horizontal surface, the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aN = mg\u000a-when objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be resolved into components that act perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane. These components can be calculated using: \u000aw(parallel) = w sin(\u03b8) = mg sin(\u03b8)\u000aw(perpendicular) = w cos(\u03b8) = mg cos(\u03b8).\u000a-the pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object that is at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aT = mg\u000a-in any inertial frame of reference (one that is not accelerated or rotated), Newton's laws have the simple forms given and all forces are real forces having a physical origin

You are also given the circumference of the planet (which needs to be converted to meters). You are told to find the mass of the planet.
p21687
VWith the givens, you plugged in the distance the wrench fell, the starting velocity (zero because it was dropped from rest), and the time it took to fall into the distance equation (kinematics). This is done to find the acceleration due to gravity on this planet. With the acceleration due to gravity value, it is used to find the force of gravity on the wrench on this planet (its weight). This new force of gravity is plugged into the forces of gravity between two masses equation. You need the radius value, so using the circumference equation (where two times pi times radius is equal to the circumference), you find the radius. Then you plug that into the force of gravity equation. And then you plug in the first mass, which is the mass of the wrench and multiply it by the gravitational constant (6.67x10^-11), and solve for the second mass, which is the mass of the planet.

Compare, for example, Jonathan Swift to George Orwell, or William Faulkner to Ernest Hemingway. We can analyze and describe an author's personal style and make judgments about how appropriate it is to the authors's purpose. They can be called flowery, explicit, succinct, bombastic, commonplace, incisive, or laconic, to name only a few examples.\u000a2. classification of authors into a group and comparison of how an author is similar to other authors. \u000aBy means of such classification and comparison, one can see how an author's __ reflects and helps define a historical period, such as the Renaissance or the Victorian period, or a literary movement, such as Romantic, Transcendental, or Realist movement.

The rainwater collected from the roof will require less treatment before use\u000aC. Both sources will need to be submetered\u000aD. The sources should be mixed together prior to using them to avoid treatment of mineral contents
p31405
VB. The rainwater collected from the roof will require less treatment before use\u000aDifferent types of nonpotable water will have different mineral contents. Pick those water sources that have the lowest mineral contents, and thus require the least treatment first, to avoid having to treat the water prior to using it. Different sources of condensates - air conditioning, steam systems, ice machines - and runoff from a building's roof require the least treatment. They have low mineral content. Runoff from the ground may require more treatment because of the pollutants that may be picked up from the grounds (fertilizers, oil, etc.). Graywater may have dissolved solids as well and require treatment.

p31457
VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

sVif a baseball has a zero velocity at some instant, is the acceleration of the baseball necessarily zero at that instant?
p34029
VIf an object has zero velocity at some instant, its acceleration doesn't have to be zero. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity over time. An object could be changing its direction and in doing so its velocity would instantaneously go to zero as it went from positive to negative or from negative to positive. If the velocity is changing it is accelerating. Therefore, it can be accelerating while its velocity is zero. An example would be a ball tied to an elastic. At first it is slowing down while traveling in the positive direction until it reaches zero velocity and then speeding up in the negative direction, all the while traveling with constant acceleration in the negative direction.

A force of magnitude F is exerted on the crate at an angle \u03b8 to the horizontal, as shown in the figure above, causing the crate to slide to the right. The surface exerts a normal force of magnitude N on the crate. As the crate slides a distance d, it gains an amount of kinetic energy (\u0394K). While F is kept constant, the angle \u03b8 is now doubled but is still less than 90 degrees.

p38619
V-projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity.\u000a-to solve projectile motion problems, perform the following steps:\u000a1.Determine a coordinate system. Then, resolve the position and/or velocity of the object in the horizontal and vertical components. The components of position are given by the quantities of x and y, and the components of the velocity are given by v(subscript x) = vcos\u03b8 and v(subscript y) = vsin\u03b8, where v is the magnitude of the velocity and \u03b8 is its direction.\u000a2. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal direction using the following equations:\u000aHorizontal motions [a(subscript x) = 0]\u000ax = x(initial) + v(sub x)t\u000av(sub x) = v(initial sub x) = v(sub x) = velocity is a constant\u000a3. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the vertical direction using the following equations:\u000aVertical motion (Assuming positive direction is up; \u000aa(sub y) = -g = -9.80 m/s^2)\u000ay = y(initial) + 1/2[v(initial sub y) + v(sub y)]t\u000av(sub y) = v(initial sub y) - gt\u000ay = y(initial) + v(initial sub y)t - 1/2gt^2\u000av(sub y)^2 = v(initial sub y)^2 - 2g[y - y(initial)]\u000a4. recombine the horizontal and vertical components of location and/or velocity using the following equations:\u000as = (square root) x^2 + y^2\u000a\u03b8 = tan ^-1 (y/x)\u000av = (square root) v(sub x)^2 + v(sub y)^2\u000a\u03b8(sub v) = tan^-1 [v(sub y)/v(sub x)]\u000a-The maximum height of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity is given by\u000ah = v(inital vertical)^2/ 2g\u000a-The maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. the range of a projectile on level ground launched at an angel \u03b8(initial) above the horizontal with initial speed is given by\u000aR = [v(inital)^2 sin2\u03b8(initial)] / g

Was that the smell of his life, his spirit, the black blood they had drained out of him? No wonder he felt weak... all the events of his life... had been curled up in him like an old man carpet snake. It was awake now. Lifting its blind head it was emerging coil on coil into the sun." *

sV4.2 Newton's First Law of Motion: Inertia
p43841
V-Newton's first law of motion states that a body at rest remains at rest, or, if in motion, remains in motion at a constant velocity unless acted on by a net external force. this is also known as the law of inertia.\u000a-inertia is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion. Inertia is related to an object's mass.\u000a- Mass, is the quantity of matter in a substance.

p43849
VThis law states that the net force (or the total force) on an object will cause an acceleration that is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object. This acceleration is always in the direction of the net force. For any system of constant mass, a larger net force will produce a larger acceleration. With a given net force, the resulting acceleration will be less for a more massive object.

V1. Definition: Torque is the cross product between the distance vector (the distance from the pivot point to the point where force is applied) and the force vector, 'a' being the angle between r and F.\u000a\u000aTorque is the tendency of a force to cause or change the rotational motion of a body. It is a twist or turning force on an object. Torque is calculated by multiplying force and distance. It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both a direction and a magnitude. Either the angular velocity for the moment of inertia of an object is changing, or both.\u000a\u000a2. General Concept: \u000a\u000a3. Units of Measure: Newton Meters (N*m)\u000a\u000a4.

It is limited to motion along a straight line, called one dimensional motion.\u000a- Displacement is the change in position of an object.\u000a-in symbols, displacement \u0394x is defined to be \u000a\u0394x = x(final) - x(initial)\u000awhere x(initial) is the initial position and x(final) is the final position. \u0394 (delta) always means "change in" whatever quantity follows it. The SI unit for displacement is the meter (m). Displacement has a direction as well as a magnitude.\u000a-When you start a problem, assign which direction will be positive.\u000a-Distance is the magnitude of displacement between two positions.\u000a-Distance traveled is the total length of the path traveled between two positions.

V-Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements.\u000a-Units are standards for expressing and comparing the measurement of physical quantities. All units can be expressed as combinations of four fundamental units.\u000a-The four fundamental units are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature\u000a-the four fundamental units are abbreviated as follows: meter, m; kilogram, kg; second, s; and ampere, A. The metric system also uses a standard set of prefixes to denote each order of magnitude greater than or lesser than the fundamental unit itself.\u000a-unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units.

VSome measuring devices require time to reach equilibrium, and taking a measurement before the instrument is stable will result in a measurement that is generally too low. The most common example is taking temperature readings with a thermometer that has not reached thermal equilibrium with its environment. A similar effect is hysteresis where the instrument readings lag behind and appear to have a "memory" effect as data are taken sequentially moving up or down through a range of values. Hysteresis is most commonly associated with materials that become magnetized when a changing magnetic field is applied.

VIn April 1986 there was an explosive leak, caused by overheating, from a non pressurized boiling-water reactor, one of the largest in Europe. The resulting clouds of radioactive material spread as far as the UK. Thirty-one people were killed in the explosion, and thousands of square kilometers of land were contaminated by fallout. By June 1992, seven times as many children in the Ukraine and Belarus were contracting thyroid cancer as before the accident, and the incidence of leukemia was rising; it was estimated that more than 6,000 people had died as a result of the accident, and that the death toll in the Ukraine alone would eventually reach 40,000.

p52197
VThe most challenging part of designing an experiment is trying to control or account for all possible factors except the one independent variable that is being analyzed. For instance, you may inadvertently ignore air resistance when measuring free-fall acceleration, or you may fail to account for the effect of the Earth's magnetic field when measuring the field of a small magnet. The best way to account for these sources of error is to brainstorm with your peers about all the factors that could possibly affect your result. This brainstorm should be done before beginning the experiment so that arrangements can be made to account for the confounding factors before taking data. Sometimes a correction can be applied to a result after taking data, but this is inefficient and not always possible.

VThe Zulu were led by King Cetshawayo. They defeated the British in January of 1879 using only cowhide shields and short spears. 1,300 British soldiers were killed. Eventually suppressed as the British convince individual leaders to give up their leader (and unity) and they will have sovereignty over their own individual lands...which doesn't last long.

VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

p55623
V-Newton's laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve problems of motion.\u000a-some problems will contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether net force = ma or net force = 0.\u000a-the normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating, the normal force will be less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force will always be less that the full weight of the object.\u000a-some problems will contain various physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apple concepts from kinematics and dynamics in order to solve these problems of motion.
