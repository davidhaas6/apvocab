sVGreek and Roman Political Institutions
p1421
VGreece and Rome featured an important variety of political forms. Both tended to emphasize aristocratic rule but there were significant examples of democratic elements as well. Politics was very important in the classical Mediterranean civilizations and offer similarities to Confucian values, yet the variety of political forms reminds the historian of India. There was no single Greek political style, but democracy is the most famous. Classical Mediterranean political theory involved ethics, duties of citizens, and skills, such as oratory. Governments supported an official religion, but tolerance of other faiths was the norm. The exception, Christianity under the Roman Empire, occurred because Christians refused to place state first in their devotion. The greatest political legacies of the Mediterranean cultures were an intense loyalty to the state, a preference for aristocratic rule, and the development of a uniform set of legal principles.

sVNew Religious Map
p1487
VBuddhism altered as it traveled beyond India, and Buddha himself became more of a savior figure than a teacher of a way. Women in China were especially drawn to this faith in that many felt it led to a more meaningful life. Ultimately, with the revival of dynasties in China, Buddhism was persecuted, but it remained a minority current. It had a greater influence in Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Christianity played a major part in the formation of postclassical civilizations in eastern and western Europe. It emphasized missionary activity even more than Buddhism did. Its beginnings were in the early days of the Roman Empire, near the eastern shores of the Mediterranean. Jesus preached compassion with great conviction and charisma, but in his lifetime he had relatively few followers. Over time, his message of the spiritual equality of all people and an afterlife of heavenly communion with God replaced the comparatively unsatisfying traditional polytheistic religion of the Romans. Later Christians, Paul most notably, saw themselves not as part of a reform movement within Judaism but rather as a new religion. The writings of Paul and other Christians became known as the New Testament in the Christian Bible. By the time Rome collapsed, Christianity had demonstrated immense spiritual power and solid organization. For example, Benedict formed a monastery in Italy that became the template for other groups of monks and nuns. Christianity had particular appeal to women, who were offered leadership opportunities in convents and who were encouraged to worship together with men, which was unlike the practices in many faiths of the time. Islam will be featured in greater detail in upcoming chapters. With Buddhism and Christianity, the Islamic faith completes the roster of world religions, with most of the earth's population following one of these three belief systems today. Polytheistic faiths continued to exist, especially in Hinduism and Daoism.

VThe Songhay people dominated the middle reaches of the Niger valley. Songhay became an independent state in the seventh century. By 1010, the rulers were Muslims and had a capital at Gao. Songhay won freedom from Mali by the 1370s and prospered as a trading state. An empire was formed under Sunni Ali (1464-1492), a great military leader, who extended rule over the entire middle Niger valley. He developed a system of provincial administration to secure the conquests. Sunni Ali's successors were Muslim rulers with the title of askia; by the mid-sixteenth century, their state dominated the central Sudan. Daily life followed patterns common in savanna states; Islamic and indigenous traditions combined. Men and women mixed freely; women went unveiled and young girls at Jenne were naked. Songhay remained dominant until defeated by Moroccans in 1591. Other states that combined Muslim and pagan ways rose among the Hausa of northern Nigeria. In the fourteenth century, the first Muslim ruler of Kano made the Hausa city a center of Muslim learning. Along with other Hausa cities, Kano followed the Islamic-indigenous amalgam present in the earlier grasslands empires. Traders and other Muslims widely spread influences, even in regions without Islamic states.

VAfrica became a permanent part of an interacting Atlantic world, both commercially and demographically. The Atlantic slave trade slowed Africa's population growth at a time when the populations of Europe, China, and other regions were expanding. The slave trade in general stimulated little positive economic change in Africa and led to economic stagnation. It also led to considerable political disruption, particularly for small-scale societies with little central authority that were frequently subject to slave raids. Some larger kingdoms, such as Kongo and Oyo, also slowly disintegrated because of the slave trade. But in other regions, like Benin and Dahomey, African authorities sought to take advantage of the new commercial opportunities to manage the slave trade in their own interests.

sVHow did South Africa's struggle against white domination change over time? (CH. 23)
p7815
VPlace - South Africa\u000aTime - 1914 to Present\u000aIn the opening decades of the twentieth century, the educated, professional, and middle-class Africans who led the political party known as the ANC sought not to overthrow the existing order but to be accepted as "civilized men" within that society. They appealed to the liberal, humane, and Christian values that white society claimed. For four decades, the leaders of the ANC pursued peaceful and moderate protest, but to little effect. During the 1950s, a new and younger generation of the ANC leadership broadened its base of support and launched nonviolent civil disobedience. In the 1960s, following the banning of the ANC, underground nationalist leaders turned to armed struggle, authorizing selected acts of sabotage and assassination, while preparing for guerrilla warfare in camps outside the country. The 1970s and 1980s saw an outbreak of protests in sprawling, segregated, and impoverished black neighborhoods as well as an increasingly active black labor movement. The South African freedom struggle also benefited from increasing international pressure on the apartheid government.

VBy time of Zhou, main social division was between land-owning gentry (2% of pop.) & peasants, who provided dues/service to these lords while also controlling some of their own land. About the only thing the Chinses nobleman and peasant had in common was dependence on land as the basic economic resource. Chinese peas¬antry depended on intensive cooperation, in southern rice region; property usually owned/regulated by village or extended family. Beneath peasantry social structure included "mean" people who performed unskilled jobs & suffered from lowest status. Social sta¬tus passed from one generation to next through inheritance, but talented person from peasant background might be given access to education & rise in bureaucracy. Officially-3 main social groups:1. landowning aristocracy/educated bureau¬crats 2. laboring masses of peasants/urban artisans=much poorer & condemned to life of hard manual labor, sometimes worked directly on large estates but in other cases had some economic independence. 3. The "mean people"-those without meaningful skills. (Performing artists in this group despite upper classes enjoyment of plays/entertainment). Mean people punished for crime more harshly & required to wear green scarves. Household slaves also in class structure, but relatively few&China did not depend on slaves fo production.

sVByzantine Society and Politics
p9433
VByzantine political patterns resembled the earlier Chinese system. An emperor, ordained by god and surrounded by elaborate court ritual, headed both church and state. Women occasionally held the throne. An elaborate bureaucracy supported the imperial authority. The officials, trained in Hellenistic knowledge in a secular school system, could be recruited from all social classes, although, as in China, aristocrats predominated. Provincial governors were appointed from the center, and a spy system helped to preserve loyalty. A careful military organization defended the empire. Troops were recruited locally and given land in return for service. Outsiders, especially Slavs and Armenians, accepted similar terms. Over time, hereditary military leaders developed regional power and displaced aristocrats who were better educated. The empire socially and economically depended on Constantinople's control of the countryside. The bureaucracy regulated trade and food prices. Peasants supplied the food and provided most tax revenues. The large urban class was kept satisfied by low food prices. A widespread commercial network extended into Asia, Russia, Scandinavia, western Europe, and Africa. Silk production techniques brought from China added a valuable product to the luxury items exported. Despite the busy trade, the large merchant class never developed political power. Cultural life centered on Hellenistic secular traditions and Orthodox Christianity. Little artistic creativity resulted, except in art and architecture. Domed buildings, colored mosaics, and painted icons expressed an art linked to religion.

p11335
V\u2022 The Bantu-speaking peoples brought agriculture to regions of Africa south of the equator, enabling larger numbers of people to live in a smaller area than was possible before their arrival.\u000a \u2022 They brought parasitic and infectious diseases, to which the gathering and hunting peoples had little immunity.\u000a \u2022 They also brought iron.\u000a \u2022 Many Bantu languages of southern Africa retain to this day distinctive "clicks" in their local dialects that they adopted from the now vanished gathering and hunting peoples that preceded them in the region.\u000a \u2022 Bantu-speaking peoples participated in networks of exchange with forest-dwelling Batwa (Pygmy) peoples. The Batwa adopted Bantu languages, while maintaining a nonagricultural lifestyle and a separate identity. The Bantu farmers regarded their Batwa neighbors as first-comers to the region and therefore closest to the ancestral and territorial spirits that determined the fertility of the land and the people. As forest-dwelling Bantu peoples grew in numbers and created chiefdoms, those chiefs appropriated the Batwa title of "owners of the land" for themselves, claimed Batwa ancestry, and portrayed the Batwa as the original "civilizers" of the earth.\u000a \u2022 Bantu farmers in East Africa increasingly adopted grains as well as domesticated sheep and cattle from the already-established people of the region.\u000a \u2022 They also acquired a variety of food crops from Southeast Asia, including coconuts, sugarcane, and especially bananas, which were brought to East Africa by Indonesian sailors and immigrants early in the first millennium C.E.

p11553
VIn 1517, Luther taught that only faith could gain salvation, and he challenged many Catholic beliefs, including papal authority, monasticism, and priestly celibacy. He said that the Bible should be translated into the vernacular. Luther resisted papal pressure and gained support in Germany where papal authority and taxes were resented. Princes saw an opportunity to secure power at the expense of the Catholic holy Roman emperor. They seized church lands and became Lutherans. Peasants interpreted Luther's actions\u2014he vehemently disagreed\u2014as a sanction for rebellion against landlords. Urban people thought Luther's views sanctioned money making and other secular pursuits. Other Protestant groups appeared. In England, Henry VIII established the Anglican Church. Frenchman Jean Calvin, based in Geneva, insisted on the principle of predestination of those who would be saved. Calvinists wanted the participation of all believers in church affairs and thus influenced attitudes toward government. They also stressed education to enable believers to read the Bible. The Catholic Church was unable to restore unity, but much of Europe remained under its authority. The Catholic Reformation worked against Protestant ideas, revived doctrine, and attacked popular beliefs. A new order, the Jesuits, spearheaded educational and missionary activity, including work in Asia and the Americas.

His sons divided the territory and later rulers lacked talent. Subsequent political history was marked by regional monarchies existing within a civilization with strong cultural unity initially centered on Catholic Christianity. French, German, English, and other separate languages emerged, providing a beginning for national identity. The rulers reigning in Germany and northern Italy initially were the strongest; they called themselves holy Roman emperors, but they failed to create a solid monarchy. Local lords and city-states went their own way.

This additional phrase became more and more accepted in the west over the centuries until the 9th-10th centuries when more and more popes began to declare it divinely inspired. This phrase was recognized as creating a false perception of the Trinity, as though there is a hierarchical structure to the Trinity, rather than a perfect Triad.

Believed in right of the laity to preach and administer sacraments.\u000a*The Cathars (Albigensians) took up the heretical teachings of groups such as the Bogomils, who advocated a pure, spiritual existence and who preached that the world was the scene of the larger battle between good and evil and that material possessions were evil. Gave up wealth and marriage and became vegetarians; saw the church as corrupt.\u000a*Pope Innocent III called for an "Albigensian crusade" to destroy the Cathars.

VA. Environment and Culture\u000aBoth depended on rivers, but were very different. Erratic and destructive flooding in Mesopotamia. Nile flooded more predictably and less destructively\u000aMesopotamia was less geographically isolated than Egypt\u000aa. Mesopotamia was vulnerable to external attack\u000ab. Egypt was usually protected from external attack\u000aMany scholars see a relationship between physical setting and culture\u000aa. more negative Mesopotamian worldview seems to reflect its precarious and violent environment \u000ab. Egyptian worldview reflected the more stable, predictable, and beneficent environment in which it took shape\u000aEnvironmental impact of rising population\u000aa. in southern Mesopotamia, deforestation, soil erosion, and salinization of the soil weakened Sumerian city-states, leading to foreign conquest and the northward shift of Mesopotamia's cultural centers\u000ab. Egypt built a more sustainable agricultural system that contributed to the remarkable continuity of its civilization\u000aB. Cities and States \u000a1. the political systems of Mesopotamia and Egypt differed sharply\u000aMesopotamia for its first thousand years was organized into a dozen or more separate city-states. Each city-state was ruled by a king and 80 percent of the population lived in city-states for protection. Outside powers built large territorial states or bureaucratic empires encompassing all or most of Mesopotamia\u000a3. Egypt\u000aSeveral earlier states or chiefdoms merged into a unified territory that stretched some 1,000 miles along the Nile\u000ac. most Egyptians lived in agricultural villages, perhaps because of greater security \u000ad. the pharaoh, a god in human form, was the focus of the Egyptian state. The pharaoh ensured the annual flooding of the Nile, the pharaoh defined the law of the land, access to the afterlife was linked to proximity to the pharaoh, local officials gained in power over time\u000aPharaohs were discredited by Nile's failure to flood\u000aC. Interaction and Exchange\u000a1. Egypt and Mesopotamia frequently interacted\u000a2. Egypt's agriculture benefited from interaction\u000a3. Mesopotamian models may have influenced Egypt's step pyramids and system of writing \u000a4. Egypt's "divine kingship" seems to have been derived from central or eastern Sudan\u000a5. both Mesopotamia and Egypt carried on extensive long-distance trade \u000a a. Mesopotamian sea trade with the Indus Valley civilization \u000ab. Mesopotamian trade with Anatolia, Egypt, Iran, and Afghanistan\u000ac. Egyptian trade in the Mediterranean and Middle East \u000ad.

Mesopotamia and Egypt were also influenced by their neighbors\u000a a. Indo-Europeans brought horse-and-chariot-based armies to Mesopotamia; Indo-European Hittites conquered the Babylonian empire\u000ab. the Hyksos invaded using chariot-based armies and ruled Egypt\u000ac.

sVClassical China
p16441
VThree dynastic cycles\u2014the Zhou, the Qin, and the Han\u2014covered many centuries of classical China. The dynastic patterns begun in classical Chinese history lasted until the early part of the twentieth century. A family of kings, called a "dynasty," began ruling China with great vigor, developing solid political institutions, and encouraging active economies. Each dynasty over time grew weaker, tax revenues declined, and social divisions occurred as the population outstripped available resources. In addition, internal rebellions and sometimes invasions from the outside contributed to each dynasty's decline. As the ruling dynasty began to falter, usually another one arose from the family of a successful general, invader, or peasant and the pattern started anew.\u000a\u000aThe Zhou dynasty (1029-258 B.C.E.) expanded the territorial boundaries of China by seizing the Yangtze River valley. The territory from the Yangtze to the Huang is often called the "Middle Kingdom," blessed with rich cropland. They promoted Mandarin as the standard language. The Zhou did not establish a strong central government but ruled instead through alliances with regional princes and noble families. This led to vulnerabilities that plagued the Zhou: the regional princes solidified their power and disregarded the central government. When the Zhou began to fail, philosophers sought to explain the political confusion. One of these, Confucius, became one of the most important thinkers in Chinese history. His orderly social and political philosophy became an important doctrine of the Qin and Han dynasties. The next dynasty, the Qin, (221-202 B.C.E.) was begun by the brutal but effective emperor Shi Huangdi. He consolidated his power, built the Great Wall, conducted a census, standardized weights and measures, and extended the borders of his realm to Hong Kong and northern Vietnam. Upon his death, massive revolts broke out and by 202 B.C.E., the Han dynasty (202 B.C.E.-220 C.E.) was established. The Han rulers lessened the brutality of the Qin but maintained its centralized rule. Early Han leaders, like Wu Ti, expanded Chinese territory and set up formal training, based on Confucian philosophy, for bureaucrats. During a long decline, the Han faced invasions and eventually fell to outside forces, especially the Huns. By the sixth century C.E., the Han too collapsed, but not before they had established distinctive political and cultural values that lasted into the twentieth century.

sVIndian Culture
p16499
VTwo major religions, Hinduism and Buddhism, marked classical India. Hinduism, the religion of India's majority, is unique among world religions in that no central figure is credited for developing it. Hinduism encouraged both worldly and mystical pursuits and was highly adaptable to varying groups. Buddhism was founded on the teachings of an Indian prince, Gautama, later called Buddha, or "enlightened one." Buddha accepted many Hindu beliefs but rejected its priests and the caste system it supported. Buddhism spread through missionaries into Sri Lanka, China, Korea, and Japan. Classical India also produced important work in science and mathematics. The Gupta-supported university at Nalanda taught religion, medicine, and architecture, as well as other disciplines. Indian scientists, borrowing ideas from Greek learning provided by Alexander the Great, made important discoveries. Still more important were the mathematical advancements, including the concept of zero, "Arabic" numerals, and the decimal system. Indian artists created shrines to Buddha called stupas and painted in lively colors.

sVAncient Chinese Society
p17849
VAs in many societies, there were large gaps between China's upper class (about 2 percent of the population) and the peasant farmers. Officially there were three main social groups in classical China. The landowning aristocracy and the bureaucrats formed the top group. Far below them were the laboring peasants and urban artisans. At the bottom of society were the "mean people," those who performed unskilled labor. Trade became increasingly important, particularly in the Han period. Technology is where the classical Chinese clearly excelled. Many developments of this era were centuries ahead of the rest of the world. Tight-knit family structures were similar to those in other civilizations, except that parents wielded much higher levels of authority over their children. Women were subordinate to men but had clearly defined roles in the family and in larger society.

sVPolitical Innovations, Chapter 17
p19385
VGreater political centralization enabled early modern monarchs to exert increased influence on economic, religious, and social life. While the Holy Roman Empire fragmented along religious and political lines, Spain, France, and England achieved greater centralization and religious unity. Spain enforced Catholic unity through the Inquisition and France through Bourbon policy, while in England the church became an arm of royal power. In both England and France, monarchs struggled with rivals over the limits of royal authority. Armies grew larger and more sophisticated while European powers strove to maintain a balance of power. High military costs drove the European powers to attempt a variety of tax and financial policies, the most successful being those of England and the Netherlands.

Also, an arms race had emerged as these nations sought to create the world's strongest armies.\u000a*In the late 1800s and early 1900s, in an attempt to maintain the balance of power, many nations in Europe entered into alliances for protection. The two most significant were the Triple Alliance of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Italy and the Triple Entente, among Britain, Russia, and France.\u000a*Nationalism, militarism, and imperialism, combined with the new reality of entangling alliances, ensured that even the smallest crisis could lead to a war that would envelop the entire European continent.

p27659
V*c. 1900 - Present\u000a*Fascism emerged in both Italy and Germany in the interwar period; both realms were faced with economic depression and in desperate need of strong leaders. Powerful dictators emerged, greatly influenced by fascist ideology.\u000a*Fascism was characterized by extreme nationalism and state control over all aspects of life.\u000a*In Italy, Benito Mussolini emphasized the state over the individual and transformed the nation into a totalitarian state.\u000a*In Germany, fascism was promoted by the National Socialist German Workers' Party, with added elements of militarism and anti-Semitism.\u000a*By the early 1930s, the Nazi Party had control of the German parliament, and by 1934 Adolf Hitler emerged as Germany's new leader.\u000a*The Nazis severely limited people's civil liberties, outlawed all other political parties, and took control of the police force.

African goods such as ebony, leopard skins, gemstones, gold and slaves went down the Nile in exchange for pottery, wine, honey, and finished products from Egypt.

In 1921, a small Chinese Communist Party was founded with Marxist ideology. The CCP grew enormously and the leader, Mao Zedong, engaged in the struggle against the Japanese, fighting out foreign forces. The Chinese would be victorious and the country would be thrown into a Civil War where the more popular group, the Goumindang, would struggle for dominance in China. Although the Guomindang provided urban development, the CCP appealed towards peasant villages for support. Eventually, after abuses of the Guomindang forces, the CCP was able to gain prominence in China while dispelling foreign forces.

sVDecline in China and India
p28897
VA combination of external weakness and invasion led to the decline of classical civilizations in China and then India. From 200 to 600 C.E., all three classical civilizations collapsed entirely or in part, and all three were invaded by outside groups from central Asia. The central Asian nomadic Huns attacked all three classical civilizations. About 100 C.E., the Han dynasty began serious decline. Weakened central government, social unrest led by overtaxed peasants, and epidemics were the most prominent sources of decline. These combined to make the government unable to stop invading nomads. However, by 600, China revived, first with the brief Sui dynasty and later (and more gloriously) with the Tang. Confucianism and bureaucracy revived. Unlike those in Rome, the cultural and political structures in China were too strong to be fully and permanently overturned. The decline in India was not as drastic as in China. By 600, Huns destroyed the Gupta Empire. For several centuries, no native Indian led a large state there. Hinduism gained ground as Buddhism, unappealing to the warrior caste, declined in its native land. After 600, Islam entered India and Arab traders took control of Indian Ocean trade routes. What survived was Hinduism (Islam never gained adherence from a majority of the population) and the caste system.

V*c. 1900 - Present\u000a*As the Cold War progressed, a new reality emerged: The struggle between the United States and the Soviet Union to claim political hegemony across the globe led to an expensive arms race and the proliferation of nuclear weapons.\u000a*Although the United States had been first to test and use the atomic bomb, the Soviet Union tested their own by 1949.\u000a*Throughout the 1950s and 1960s, both nations continued to build nuclear arsenals. Each side had the technology, intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs), to directly attack the other.\u000a*This arms race redefined war and diplomacy. An awareness on both sides that any direct fighting between the two could lead to nuclear war led to a New Cold War reality: mutually assured destruction (MAD).\u000a*Weapon building continued and a new concept emerged - deterrence: as long as each side had enough weapons, neither would attack.\u000a*In the mid 1960s, the United States began to explore the possibility of arms control and/or reduction. In 1972, SALT I (Strategic Arms Limitation Treaty), signed by the two nations, established limits and restraints on their weapons programs.

VThe Greeks and Romans did not create a significant world religion. Their religions derived from a complex set of gods and goddesses who were seen as regulating human life. Both Mediterranean and Indian religious lore reflected the common heritage of Indo-European invaders. Greco-Roman religion tended toward an of-this-world approach with lessons that illustrated human passions and foibles but offered little in regard to modeling ethical behavior. Thus, separate models of moral philosophy were developed, by such men as Aristotle and Cicero, who like Confucius, taught the importance of moderation and balance in human behavior. Socrates taught his followers to question conventional wisdom by using rational inquiry. In the sciences, Greek work in geometry and anatomy were especially important. The greatest Roman contribution to the sciences was in engineering. In the arts and literature, the Greeks had few equals, particularly in sculpture, architecture, and plays. The Romans mimicked but rarely surpassed the Greek innovators in these fields.

p29689
VMany of the British settlers sought to escape aspects of an old European society rather than to recreate it, as was the case for most Spanish and Portuguese colonists.\u000aThe easy availability of land, the climate and geography of North America, and the "outsider" status of many British settlers made it even more difficult to follow the Spanish or Portuguese colonial pattern of sharp class hierarchy, large rural estates, and dependent laborers.\u000aBritish settlers in North America were much more numerous than Spanish or Portuguese settlers in Latin America, making up some 90 percent or more of the population of the New England and middle Atlantic colonies by the time of the American Revolution.\u000aThe British colonies were almost pure settler colonies, without the racial mixing that was so prominent in Spanish and Portuguese territories.\u000aA largely Protestant England was far less interested in spreading Christianity among the remaining native peoples than were the large and well-funded missionary societies of Catholic Spain. Moreover, church and state were not so closely connected in the British colonies as they were in Latin America.\u000aBritish colonies developed greater mass literacy and traditions of local self-government and vigorously contested the prerogatives of royal governors sent to administer their affairs.\u000aBritain had nothing resembling the elaborate bureaucracy that governed Spanish colonies.

Vwas different from all others, it was based on the belief of "citizenship", meaning, free people should run the affairs of the state.

Examples of Solon's laws were, debt slavery was abolished, all citizens were allowed to participate in assembly, and public officers were paid and chosen by lot (this allowed access to public office for more people). However, women, slaves, and foreigners were excluded from all forms of government. The democracy gave all citizens equality before the law. All men, as a whole got to vote, which was not allowed in any other empire. Also, the change in laws made the Assembly the center of political life.

What written records and archaeological evidence that did survive have allowed historians and scientists to create a number of theories as to why such powerful civilizations over such a large geographical area could collapse so quickly and completely.

p31219
VMuslim invasions from the seventh century added to the complexity of Indian civilization. Previous nomadic invaders usually had blended over time into India's sophisticated civilization. Muslims, possessors of an equally sophisticated, but very different, culture were a new factor. The open, tolerant, and inclusive Hindu religion was based on a social system dominated by castes; whereas Islam was doctrinaire, monotheistic, evangelical, and egalitarian. In the earlier period of contact, conflict predominated, but as time passed, although tensions persisted, peaceful commercial and religious exchange occurred in a society where Muslim rulers governed Hindu subjects.Although Muslims came as conquerors, early interaction with Indians was dominated by peaceful exchanges. The main carriers of Islam were traders and Sufi mystics, the latter drawing followers because of similarities to Indian holy men. Their mosques and schools became centers of regional political power providing protection to local populations. Low and outcast Hindus were welcomed. Buddhists were the most numerous converts. Buddhist spiritual decline had debased its practices and turned interest to the vigorous new religion of Islam. Others converted to escape taxes or through intermarriage. Muslim migrants fleeing thirteenth and fourteenth century Mongol incursions also increased the Islamic community.

British colonies attracted large numbers of free immigrants, but indentured servitude and slavery were crucial to economic development. The southern colonies' dependence of forced labor and plantation agriculture led to a society that was more hierarchical and less democratic than those found in the colonies of New England and the Middle Atlantic region. With small population and limited resources, French colonies in North America depended on political and military alliances and commercial relations with native peoples. Eventually England defeated France and gained control of North America east of the Mississippi.

VSugar production required larger investments in land, slaves, and machinery than other forms of colonial agriculture. Large-scale sugar plantations were more efficient and profitable than smaller plantations. Sugar plantations had high environmental costs due to deforestation and soil exhaustion.

The problem remained, however, that these guns were hand-made by extremely skilled workmen and were, therefore, very expensive.\u000a*Mass production was first achieved in 1803 by Marc Isambard Brunel with Henry Maudslay and Simon Goodrich, with contributions by Brigadier-General Sir Samuel Bentham, Inspector General of the Naval Works at Portsmouth Block Mills for the British Royal Navy during the Napoleonic War. By 1808 annual production had reached 130,000 sailing blocks (pulleys).

p31981
VIndia's caste system was used to establish a social hierarchy distinguishing social structure. This system regulated social relationships, work roles, and promoted public order. The caste system's 5 initial classes broke down into several sub-castes, which determined the groups of people one was allowed to dine or marry within. It was practically impossible to move up to a higher caste except for certain marriage conditions or reincarnation, but it was possible to fall lower due to certain actions such as marrying someone outside one's caste or taking on inappropriate work for one's social rank. Hereditary principles were a strong aspect of the caste system as well, having children placed in their parent's caste. This system gave India a definite social framework.

sVSong Dynasty emergence
p33429
VThe reign of Emperor Xuanzong (713-756) marked the zenith of Tang power. He initially advanced political and economic reform; later he turned to patronizing the arts and the pleasures of the imperial city. Xuanzong became infatuated with an imperial harem woman, Yang Guifei. She filled upper levels of government with her relatives and gained authority in court politics. Rival cliques stimulated unrest, while lack of royal direction caused economic distress and military weakness. A serious revolt occurred in 755. The rebels were defeated, and Yang Guifei was killed, but Xuanzong and succeeding rulers provided weak leadership for the dynasty. Nomadic frontier peoples and regional governors used the disorder to gain virtual independence. Worsening economic conditions in the ninth century caused many revolts, some of them popular movements led by peasants.

VThomas Hobbes (5 April 1588 - 4 December 1679) was an English philosopher, best known today for his work on political philosophy. His 1651 book Leviathan established social contract theory, the foundation of most later Western political philosophy. Though on rational grounds a champion of absolutism for the sovereign, Hobbes also developed some of the fundamentals of European liberal thought: the right of the individual; the natural equality of all men; the artificial character of the political order, the view that all legitimate political power must be "representative" and based on the consent of the people; and a liberal interpretation of law which leaves people free to do whatever the law does not explicitly forbid.

p35179
VBrazil became the world's leading sugar producer. The growth and processing of sugar cane required large amounts of capital and labor. Brazil, with a single crop produced by slave labor, was the first plantation colony. In its social hierarchy, white planter families, linked to merchants and officials, dominated colonial life. Slaves, composing about one half of the total population at the close of the seventeenth century, occupied the bottom level. In-between was a growing population of mixed origins, poor whites, Indians, and Africans who were artisans, small farmers, herders, and free workers. Portugal created a bureaucratic administrative structure under the direction of a governor general that integrated Brazil into the imperial system. The cores of the bureaucracy were lawyers. Regional governors often acted independently and, along with the governor general, reported directly to Lisbon. Missionaries had an important role; they ran ranches, mills, schools, and church institutions. During the seventeenth century, Brazil became the predominant Portuguese colony. It remained closely tied to Portugal; there were no universities or printing presses to stimulate independent intellectual life.

V*c. 1450 - c. 1750\u000a*The unification of Japan in the late 1500s led to the establishment of a military government led by a shogun, which brought nearly 300 years of peace and stability to the nation (the Pax Tokugawa).\u000a*Their policies promoted isolation and regulated contact with foreigners.\u000a*Shoguns (supreme military rulers) sought to centralize their authority and maintain stability.\u000a*In prior periods, a decentralized feudal structure had allowed for the daimyo (landowning families) to gain lower and rule independent of the emperor; shoguns centralized authority and thus took power away from the daimyo.\u000a*Daimyo estates were broken up, and attendance at the imperial court in Edo (modern-day Tokyo) was required; daimyo needed the permission of the shogun to marry and even to repair their castles.

VEnvoy who was sent by emperor Han Wudi (Han dynasty) on a a mission to lands west of China--purpose was to find allies who could help combat the nomadic Xiongnu. Soon after he left Han territory he was captured by Xiongnu forces and held in comfortable captivity for ten years (he was allowed to keep his personal servant, issued a Xiongnu wife and had son). He escaped with his family after suspicions about him had subsided and fled to the west, making it as far as Bactria but failing to find allies against the Xiongnu. While returning to China he was again captured by the Xiongnu but managed to escape after one year (the death of the Xiongnu leader led to turmoil). He and his party returned to China and a warm welcome from Han Wudi in 126 BCE. Apart from political and military intelligence about western lands and their peoples, he brought back information of immense commercial value. While in Bactria about 128 BCE, he noticed Chinese goods--textiles and bamboo articles--offered for sale in local markets. He learned that they had come from southwest China by way of Bengal. From that information he deduced the possibility of establishing trade relations between China and Bactria through India.

p37405
VThe spread of Greek language and culture (Hellenism) throughout the Mediterranean, starting with t\u000a\u000ahe conquests of Alexander the Great. Upon Alexander's death at the age of thirty-three (323 B.C.E.), his realm was divided among his leading generals. During their reigns and those of their successors, Hellenism (i.e., Greek culture) continued to flourish in major urban centers around the eastern Mediterranean (less so in rural areas). People traveling to different areas could communicate with people of other kingdoms through Greek. More than at any time in previous history, the eastern Mediterranean that emerged in Alexander's wake experienced a form of cultural unity and cosmopolitanism (a "cosmopolite" is a "citizen of the world," as opposed to a person who belongs to only one locality). The Roman Empire arose in the context of the Hellenistic world and took full advantage of its unity, promoting the use of Greek language, accepting aspects of Greek culture, and even taking over features of the Greek religion, to the point that the Greek and Roman gods came to be thought of as the same, only with different names. This complex unity achieved culturally through Hellenization and politically through the conquests of Rome is summed up by the term Greco-Roman world.

With this goal in mind, the sharia became the law of the land, and religious leaders assumed the reins of government. Culture and education were regulated by the state according to Islamic law.

VIn the sixth century C.E. camel nomads dominated Arabia. Cities were dependent upon alliances with surrounding tribes. Pressures for change came from the Byzantine and Sasanian empires, and from the presence of Judaism and Christianity. Muhammad, a member of the Banu Hashim clan of the Quraysh, was born about 570. Left an orphan, he was raised by his father's family and became a merchant. Muhammad resided in Mecca where he married a wealthy widow, Khadijah. Merchant travels allowed Muhammad to observe the forces undermining clan unity and to encounter the spread of monotheistic ideas. Muhammad became dissatisfied with a life focused on material gain and went to meditate in the hills. In 610 he began receiving revelations transmitted from Allah via the angel Gabriel. Later, written in Arabic and collected in the Quran, they formed the basis for Islam.

VThe Elizabethan era is the epoch in English history marked by the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558-1603). Historians often depict it as the golden age in English history. This "golden age" represented the apogee of the English Renaissance and saw the flowering of poetry, music and literature. The era is most famous for theatre, as William Shakespeare and many others composed plays that broke free of England's past style of theatre. It was an age of exploration and expansion abroad, while back at home, the Protestant Reformation became more acceptable to the people, most certainly after the Spanish Armada was repulsed. It was also the end of the period when England was a separate realm before its royal union with Scotland.

sVLimited Government
p41435
VWestern Europe remained politically divided. The Holy Roman Empire's territories in Germany and Italy were controlled by local lords and city-states. The pope ruled in central Italy. Regional units prevailed in the Low Countries. In strong feudal monarchies, power was limited by the church, aristocratic military strength, and developing urban centers. King John of England in 1215 was forced to recognize feudal rights in the Magna Carta. Parliaments, bodies representing privileged groups, emerged in Catalonia in 1000. In England a parliament, operating from 1265, gained the right to rule on taxation and related policy matters. Most members of societies were not represented, but the creation of representative bodies was the beginning of a distinctive political process not present in other civilizations. Despite the checks, European rulers made limited progress in advancing central authority. Their weakness was demonstrated by local wars turning into larger conflicts, such as the Hundred Years War of the fourteenth century between the French and English.

sVBasic characteristics of the Byzantine Empire
p42141
V-as Western Europe succumbed to the Germanic invasions, imperial power shifted to the Byzantine empire (the eastern part of the Roman Empire)\u000a-Constantinople became throstle capital of the empire\u000a-the height of the first period of Byzantine history (324-632) was the reign of Emperor Justinian (r. 537- 565) and his wife empress Theodora (d.548)\u000a-imperial goal in the east was to centralize government and impose legal and doctrinal conformity \u000a-Byzantine emperors ruled by absolute authority, especially over the economy (especially silk production)\u000a-Justinian collated and revised roman law. His corpus juris civilis (body of civil law) had little effect on medieval common law. However beginning with the Renaissance, it provided the foundation for the most European law down to the 19th century \u000a-religion as well as law served imperial centralization. In 380 Christianity had been proclaimed the official religion of the eastern empire. Now all other religions were considered "demented and insane"\u000a-during Justinian's reign, the empires strength was its more than 1,500 cities. The largest with 350,000 inhabitants, was Constantinople the cultural crossroads of Asian and European civilizations \u000a-in the seventh century the empire lost Syria, the holy land, Egypt, and North African to invading Islamic armies\u000a-use of local language in church, marriage of priests\u000a-Byzantine emperors resent papal attempts to interfere in the iconoclastic dispute\u000a-hostility towards Charlemagne to proclaim himself a Roman Empire in the 9th century \u000a-belief that western rulers were crude and unsophisticated \u000a-as a result of the debate, the Roman Catholic pope excommunicated the patriarch and his followers\u000a-the patriarch responded by excommunicating all Catholics \u000a-this the split between west and east was done\u000a-in 1204 the crusaders attacked, conquered, and pillaged the city of Constantinople, a goal that the Muslims had been trying to achieve for centuries \u000a-throughout the early Middle Ages the Byzantine empire remained a protective barrier between Western Europe and hostile Persian, Arab, and Turkish armies\u000a-the Byzantines were also a major conduit of classical learning and science into the west doe to the Renaissance. While Western Europeans were in their dark age, the cities of the Byzantine empire provided a model of a civilized society\u000a-eastern Europe follows a different cultural path than Western Europe

Erasmus lived against the backdrop of the growing European religious Reformation, but while he was critical of the abuses within the Catholic Church and called for reform, he kept his distance from Luther and Melanchthon and continued to recognize the authority of the pope, emphasizing a middle way with a deep respect for traditional faith, piety and grace, rejecting Luther's emphasis on faith alone. Erasmus remained a member of the Roman Catholic Church all his life, remaining committed to reforming the Church and its clerics' abuses from within.

After the war, there was a significant increase in nationalist feelings throughout the colonial world.\u000a*The Ottoman and Austro-Hungarian empires were broken up.\u000a*The Allies met in Paris in 1919.

The results of this concept was the development of the mandate system.\u000a*Perhaps most significant, World War I ended with many nations dissatisfied, and this sense of unhappiness would ultimately play a role in the rise of World War II.

At Tenochtitlan, Moctezuma II was captured and killed. By 1535, most of central Mexico was under Spanish control as the Kingdom of New Spain. Francisco Pizarro in 1535 began the conquest of the Inca Empire, then weakened by civil war. Cuzco fell in 1533. The Spanish built their capital at Lima, and by 1540, most of Peru was under their control. Other Spanish expeditions expanded colonial borders. Francisco Vazquez de Coronado explored the American southwest in the 1540s; Pedro de Valdivia conquered central Chile and founded Santiago in 1541. By 1570, there were 192 Spanish urban settlements in the Americas.

VThe Thirty Years' War was a series of wars in Central Europe between 1618 and 1648. It was one of the longest and most destructive conflicts in European history.[16] It was the deadliest European religious war, resulting in eight million casualties. Initially a war between various Protestant and Catholic states in the fragmented Holy Roman Empire, it gradually developed into a more general conflict involving most of the great powers. These states employed relatively large mercenary armies, and the war became less about religion and more of a continuation of the France-Habsburg rivalry.\u000aSweden, Denmark, United Provinces, France, Bohemia, Saxony, The Palatinate,\u000aBrandenburg-Prussia, Brunswick-Lüneburg, \u000aEngland, Scotland, Transylvania vs Austria, Bohemia, Spanish Empire, Hungary, Kingdom of Croatia, Denmark.

sVThe Problem of Succession and the Sunni-Shi'i Split
p45123
VMuhammad, the last of the prophets, could not have a successor possessing his attributes. He had not established a procedure for selecting a new leader. After a troubled process Abu Bakr was chosen as caliph, the leader of the Islamic community. Break-away tribes and rival prophets were defeated during the Ridda Wars to restore Islamic unity. Arab armies invaded the weak Byzantine and Persian empires where they were joined by Bedouins who had migrated earlier. \u000aArab victories for a time covered old tribal internal divisions. The murder of Uthman, the third caliph, caused a succession struggle. Muhammad's earliest followers supported Ali, but he was rejected by the Umayyads. In the ensuing hostilities, Ali won the advantage until he accepted a plea for mediation at Siffin in 657. Ali lost the support of his most radical adherents, and the Umayyads won the renewed hostilities. The Umayyad leader, Mu'awiya, was proclaimed caliph in 660. Ali was assassinated in 661; his son, Husayn, was killed at Karbala in 680. The dispute left permanent division within Islam. The Shi'i, eventually dividing into many sects, continued to uphold the rights of Ali's descendants to be caliphs.

sV30. Explain the beliefs of Hinduism as it became a more formal religion by the first centuries of the common era. (gurus, brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, reincarnation)
p45159
Vmystics, called gurus as they gathered disciples & brahman priests agreed on certain doctrines, as Hinduism became an increas¬ingly formal religion by first centuries of the com¬mon era. The basic holy essence, called brahma, formed part of everything in this world. Every living creature participates in this divine principle. Divine aspects of brahma are manifested in forms of sev¬eral gods, including Vishnu, the preserver & Shiva, the destroyer. The world of our senses is far less important than the world of the divine soul; a proper life is devoted to seeking union with this soul. This quest may take many lifetimes, so Hindus stressed principle of reincarnation, in which souls do not die when bodies do but pass into other beings, either human or animal. Whether the soul it rises to a higher-caste person or falls to an animal, depends on how good a life the person has led. After many good lives, the soul reaches full union with the soul of brahma & worldly suffering ceases.

p45963
VDaoism would join with strong Bud¬dhist influence from India during chaos that fol¬lowed collapse of Han dynasty; guaranteed China's people would not be united by a single religious or philosophical system. Individuals embraced elements from both Daoism &Confucianism; many emperors favored Daoism& accepted its spread because some found solace in Daoist belief & because its otherworldly emphasis posed no real political threat. Confucian scholars disagreed vigorously with Daoist thinking (myster¬ies/magic), but saw little reason to challenge its influence. Daoism provided many Chinese with ceremonies to promote harmony with mysterious life force. Chinese govt from Han dynasty onward was able to persuade Daoist priests to include expressions of loyalty to emperor in temple services>heightened Daoism's political compatibility with Confucianism

The idea of an Africa sharply divided into separate and distinct "tribes" was in fact a European notion that facilitated colonial administration and reflected Europeans' belief in African primitiveness.\u000aNew ethnic identities were not simply imposed by Europeans; Africans found ethnic or tribal labels useful. This was especially true in rapidly growing urban areas where competition for jobs, housing, and education was very intense. Migrants to the city found it helpful to categorize themselves and others in larger ethnic terms. Thus, in many colonial cities, people who spoke similar languages, shared a common culture, or came from the same general part of the country began to think of themselves as a single people\u2014a new tribe.

sVAncient India
p48831
VImportant reasons for India's distinctive path lie in geography and early historical experience. India's topography shaped a number of vital features of its civilization. The vast Indian subcontinent is partially separated from the rest of Asia (and particularly from East Asia) by northern mountain ranges. Mountain passes linked India to civilizations in the Middle East. Though it was not as isolated as China, the subcontinent was nevertheless set apart within Asia. The most important agricultural regions are along the two great rivers, the Ganges and the Indus. During its formative period, called the Vedic and Epic ages, the Aryans (Indo-Europeans), originally from central Asia, impressed their own stamp on Indian culture. During these ages, the caste system, Sanskrit, and various belief systems were introduced. \u000aBy 600 B.C.E., India had passed through its formative stage. Indian development during its classical era did not take on the structure of rising and falling dynasties, as in China. Patterns in Indian history were irregular and often consisted of invasions through the subcontinent's northwestern mountain passes. As a result, classical India alternated between widespread empires and a network of smaller kingdoms. Even during the rule of the smaller kingdoms, both economic and cultural life advanced. The Maurya and Gupta dynasties were the most successful in India, run entirely by Indians and not by outside rulers. The greatest of the Mauryan emperors was Ashoka (269-232 B.C.E.). The Guptas did not produce as dynamic a leader as Ashoka, but they did provide classical India with its greatest period of stability. \u000aClassical India did not develop the solid political and cultural institutions the Chinese experienced, nor the high level of political interest of Greece and Rome. Its greatest features, still observable today, were political diversity and regionalism. The Guptas, for example, did not require a single language for all their subjects. The development of a rigid caste system lies at the heart of this characteristic. In its own way, the caste system promoted tolerance, allowing widely different social classes to live next to each other, separated by social strictures. Loyalty to caste superseded loyalty to any overall ruler. Religion, particularly Hinduism, was the only uniting influence in Indian culture.

Cheaper goods were more affordable; as a result, the standard of living rose for most Europeans.\u000a*Conditions in the factories in the early years were harsh and dangerous. Workers received little pay, worked long hours, and faced unsafe working conditions. Over time, governments stepped in to pass laws to protect workers (such as minimum-wage legislation).\u000a*Labor unions also emerged as workers organized to protect their rights and gain fair treatment in the workplace.
