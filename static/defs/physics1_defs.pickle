Substitute sin theta and cos theta with y_p/r and x_p/r respectively since the angle is the same: (-vy_p/r)i + (vx_p/r)j 5. take the derivative of the equation in order to find the acceleration vector which is dv/dt: (-v/r dy_p/dt)i + ( v/r dx_p/dt) which would be a = ( -v^2/r cos theta)i + (- v^2/r sin theta)j ( dy_p/dt = x_y = v cos theta and dx_p/dt = x_x = -v sin theta) 6. resolve the acceleration vector a = ( a_x^2 + a_y^2)^1/2 = v^2/r ( cos^2 theta + sin^2 theta) ^1/2 = v^2/r (1)1/2= v^2/r

The product of vectors a & b can also be expressed it terms of each's unit vectors : ( a_xi + a_yj + a_zk)(b_xi + b_yj + b_zk) = a_xb_x + a_yb_y + a_zb_z since only values with the same direction component can be multiplied. Can also be represented using matrix multiplication with one of the vector's unit unit vectors being transposed.

sVInstrument resolution (random)
p5115
VAll instruments have finite precision that limits the ability to resolve small measurement differences. For instance, a meter stick cannot distinguish distances to a precision much better than about half of its smallest scale division (0.5 mm in this case). One of the best ways to obtain more precise measurements is to use a null difference method instead of measuring a quantity directly. Null or balance methods involve using instrumentation to measure the difference between two similar quantities, one of which is known very accurately and is adjustable. The adjustable reference quantity is varied until the difference is reduced to zero. The two quantities are then balanced and the magnitude of the unknown quantity can be found by comparison with the reference sample. With this method, problems of source instability are eliminated, and the measuring instrument can be very sensitive and does not even need a scale.

The most common use of gravitational potential energy is for an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant at about 9.8 m/s2. Since the zero of gravitational potential energy can be chosen at any point (like the choice of the zero of a coordinate system), the potential energy at a height h above that point is equal to the work which would be required to lift the object to that height with no net change in kinetic energy. It is negative.

p8903
VIn physics, it is one of the distinct forms that matter takes on. Four states of matter are observable in everyday life: solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. Many other states are known to exist only in extreme situations, such as Bose-Einstein condensates, neutron-degenerate matter and quark-gluon plasma, which occur in situations of extreme cold, extreme density and extremely high-energy color-charged matter respectively. Some other states are believed to be possible but remain theoretical for now. For a complete list of all exotic states of matter, see the list of states of matter.

p9557
VRefrigerant is used to remove heat energy from inside of the refrigerator, then it travels outside the refrigerator where it releases the heat energy to the atmosphere\u000a1. Refrigerant absorbs heat energy from inside the refrigerator and lowers the temperature of the interior\u000a2. Refrigerant increases in temp and becomes vapor, it is then compressed and the compressor does work on the gas (system) adiabatic process increases internal energy and pressure, therefore temp\u000a3. The refrigerant moves outside and releases heat energy to the surrounding air\u000a4. The refrigerant becomes a liquid and enters the refrigerator again. IT enters and expansion valve, expands without absorbing heat, does work, and moves from high pressure region to low pressure region as its volume increases.

V-an object in free-fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible.\u000a-on earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration due to gravity, which averages \u000ag = 9.80 m/s^2\u000a- whether the acceleration should be taken as +g or -g is determined by your choice of coordinate system. If you choose the upward direction as positive, a = -g = -9.8 m/s^2 is negative. In the oppisite case, a = +g = 9.8 m/s^2 is positive. Since acceleration is constant, the kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate +g or -g substituted for a.\u000a-For objects in free-fall, up is normally taken as positive for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

V1. Objects and systems have properties such as mass and charge. Systems may have internal structure.\u000a2. Fields existing in space can be used to explain interactions.\u000a3. The interactions of an object with other objects can be described by forces.\u000a4. Interactions between systems can result in changes in those systems.\u000a5. Changes that occur as a result of interactions are constrained by conservation laws.\u000a6. Waves can transfer energy momentum from one location another without the permanent transfer of mass and serve as a mathematical model for the description of other phenomena.\u000a7. The mathematics of probability can be used to describe the behavior of complex systems and to interpret the behavior of quantum mechanical systems.

VFirst, make a situational diagram. Checked that the angle theta you are solving for was between the force (the tension) and the direction of movement. So, you are able to use W = F*d*cos(theta). Solve for cos(theta) by moving all known values to one side of the equation (in this case that means dividing work over (tension times distance). You find the inverse cosine (cos^-1 = 2nd+cos button on calculator) of your variables plugged in, and that gives you the angle.

You are also given the circumference of the planet (which needs to be converted to meters). You are told to find the mass of the planet.
p21585
VWith the givens, you plugged in the distance the wrench fell, the starting velocity (zero because it was dropped from rest), and the time it took to fall into the distance equation (kinematics). This is done to find the acceleration due to gravity on this planet. With the acceleration due to gravity value, it is used to find the force of gravity on the wrench on this planet (its weight). This new force of gravity is plugged into the forces of gravity between two masses equation. You need the radius value, so using the circumference equation (where two times pi times radius is equal to the circumference), you find the radius. Then you plug that into the force of gravity equation. And then you plug in the first mass, which is the mass of the wrench and multiply it by the gravitational constant (6.67x10^-11), and solve for the second mass, which is the mass of the planet.

sVThis is a circular motion problem. There is a swing with a central shaft, and rod, with a rope attached to that. You are given a rod distance, a rope distance and an angle (theta) as the rope swings in a circle. You must draw the free body diagram, find the time of one revolution given the angle, and answer if the angle depends on the weight of the passenger.
p23801
VFirst find the total radius with trig. \u000a\u000aYour free body diagram has one downward force (force of gravity, mg), and the tension is split into one upward Ty and one inward Tx. You set the upward Ty equal to the downward force of gravity and solve for T. Then you plug that into the inward Tx definition. That is the force causing movement, or F=ma. So You can solve for acceleration by setting the inward force equal to mass times acceleration. \u000a\u000aThen you can solve for velocity using your acceleration in the circular acceleration formula. \u000a\u000aThen you plug velocity and radius into the revolution formula to find how much time it takes for one revolution to go around. \u000a\u000aThe mass cancels out when you do the problem. \u000a\u000a(You must find the value of sin(30).

p31335
VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

sVif a baseball has a zero velocity at some instant, is the acceleration of the baseball necessarily zero at that instant?
p33797
VIf an object has zero velocity at some instant, its acceleration doesn't have to be zero. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity over time. An object could be changing its direction and in doing so its velocity would instantaneously go to zero as it went from positive to negative or from negative to positive. If the velocity is changing it is accelerating. Therefore, it can be accelerating while its velocity is zero. An example would be a ball tied to an elastic. At first it is slowing down while traveling in the positive direction until it reaches zero velocity and then speeding up in the negative direction, all the while traveling with constant acceleration in the negative direction.

sV3.4 Projectile Motion
p38501
V-projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity.\u000a-to solve projectile motion problems, perform the following steps:\u000a1.Determine a coordinate system. Then, resolve the position and/or velocity of the object in the horizontal and vertical components. The components of position are given by the quantities of x and y, and the components of the velocity are given by v(subscript x) = vcos\u03b8 and v(subscript y) = vsin\u03b8, where v is the magnitude of the velocity and \u03b8 is its direction.\u000a2. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal direction using the following equations:\u000aHorizontal motions [a(subscript x) = 0]\u000ax = x(initial) + v(sub x)t\u000av(sub x) = v(initial sub x) = v(sub x) = velocity is a constant\u000a3. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the vertical direction using the following equations:\u000aVertical motion (Assuming positive direction is up; \u000aa(sub y) = -g = -9.80 m/s^2)\u000ay = y(initial) + 1/2[v(initial sub y) + v(sub y)]t\u000av(sub y) = v(initial sub y) - gt\u000ay = y(initial) + v(initial sub y)t - 1/2gt^2\u000av(sub y)^2 = v(initial sub y)^2 - 2g[y - y(initial)]\u000a4. recombine the horizontal and vertical components of location and/or velocity using the following equations:\u000as = (square root) x^2 + y^2\u000a\u03b8 = tan ^-1 (y/x)\u000av = (square root) v(sub x)^2 + v(sub y)^2\u000a\u03b8(sub v) = tan^-1 [v(sub y)/v(sub x)]\u000a-The maximum height of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity is given by\u000ah = v(inital vertical)^2/ 2g\u000a-The maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. the range of a projectile on level ground launched at an angel \u03b8(initial) above the horizontal with initial speed is given by\u000aR = [v(inital)^2 sin2\u03b8(initial)] / g

V4. First: 1/10 millionth of the distance between north pole and equator, second: two scratches on a platinum iridium plate which is now kept at the International Bureau of Weights in Paris (secondary standards were determined based on this bar), third: In 1960, a new standard for the meter, based on the wavelength of light, was adopted. Specifically, the standard for the meter was redefined to be 1 650 763.73 wavelengths of a particular orange-red light emitted by atoms of krypton-86 (a particular isotope, or type, of krypton) in a gas discharge tube that can be set up anywhere in the world. This awkward number of wavelengths was chosen so that the new standard would be close to the old meter-bar standard, and fourth: By 1983, however, the demand for higher precision had reached such a point that even the krypton-86 standard could not meet it, and in that year a bold step was taken. The meter was redefined as the distance traveled by light in a specified time interval. This time interval was chosen so that the speed of light c is exactly c  299 792 458 m/s.

VThis law states that the net force (or the total force) on an object will cause an acceleration that is proportional to the force and inversely proportional to the mass of the object.

With a given net force, the resulting acceleration will be less for a more massive object.

sVExplain the differences between kinetic and static friction without using equations.
p45405
VKinetic friction is a force that opposes motion. Static friction is a force that acts on an object to resist the initiation of motion by an applied force. For a given interaction between two types of materials, static friction will increase with the applied force until it reaches a maximum value and the objects begin to move relative to each other. Kinetic friction is a constant and is less than the maximum value of static friction.

sV4.5 Normal, Tension, and Other Examples of Forces
p45641
V-when objects rest on a surface, the surface applies a force to the object that supports the weight of the object. This supporting force acts perpendicular to and away from the surface. It is called normal force.\u000a-when objects rest on a non-accelerating horizontal surface, the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aN = mg\u000a-when objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be resolved into components that act perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane. These components can be calculated using: \u000aw(parallel) = w sin(\u03b8) = mg sin(\u03b8)\u000aw(perpendicular) = w cos(\u03b8) = mg cos(\u03b8).\u000a-the pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object that is at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aT = mg\u000a-in any inertial frame of reference (one that is not accelerated or rotated), Newton's laws have the simple forms given and all forces are real forces having a physical origin

V-Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements.\u000a-Units are standards for expressing and comparing the measurement of physical quantities. All units can be expressed as combinations of four fundamental units.\u000a-The four fundamental units are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature\u000a-the four fundamental units are abbreviated as follows: meter, m; kilogram, kg; second, s; and ampere, A. The metric system also uses a standard set of prefixes to denote each order of magnitude greater than or lesser than the fundamental unit itself.\u000a-unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units.

For instance, you may inadvertently ignore air resistance when measuring free-fall acceleration, or you may fail to account for the effect of the Earth's magnetic field when measuring the field of a small magnet. The best way to account for these sources of error is to brainstorm with your peers about all the factors that could possibly affect your result. This brainstorm should be done before beginning the experiment so that arrangements can be made to account for the confounding factors before taking data. Sometimes a correction can be applied to a result after taking data, but this is inefficient and not always possible.

sVHarmonic Oscillator
p55213
VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

sV4.7 Further Applications of Newton's Laws of Motion
p55389
V-Newton's laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve problems of motion.\u000a-some problems will contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether net force = ma or net force = 0.\u000a-the normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating, the normal force will be less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force will always be less that the full weight of the object.\u000a-some problems will contain various physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apple concepts from kinematics and dynamics in order to solve these problems of motion.
