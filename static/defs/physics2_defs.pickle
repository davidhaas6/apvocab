VKinetic friction is a force that opposes motion. Static friction is a force that acts on an object to resist the initiation of motion by an applied force. For a given interaction between two types of materials, static friction will increase with the applied force until it reaches a maximum value and the objects begin to move relative to each other. Kinetic friction is a constant and is less than the maximum value of static friction.

Vfalse - Newton's 3rd law can be summarized as follows: A physical interaction (e.g., gravity) operates between two interacting objects and generates a pair of opposite forces, one on each object. It offers you a way to test for real forces (i.e., those that belong on the force side of \u2211F\u20d7 =ma\u20d7 )\u2014there should be a 3rd law pair force operating on some other object for each real force that acts on the object whose acceleration is under consideration.

sVWhy does the image move in front of or behind the retina for near- or far-sighted people as is described above? Draw some diagrams of a convex lens and try to figure it out. (Hint: It has something to do with the shape of the lens.)
p1033
VFor a near-sighted person, the lens has too much focusing power (the focal length is too small). This causes the light to bend more than it should, and the image is formed closer to the lens than it should. See the second illustration for question #29, imagining that the rays are converging to the retina, and visualize what it would look like with more bending than expected. \u000a\u000aFor a far-sighted person, the lens has too little focusing power (the focal length is too large). This causes the light to bend less than it should, and the image is formed farther from the lens than it should. See the second illustration for question #29, visualizing what it would look like with less bending than expected. A fully-functioning eye can accommodate a wide variety of incoming light angles because the ciliary muscles of the eye are capable of adjusting the curvature of the lens and therefore its focal point. As we age, however, we gradually lose this flexibility. In persons born with a near- or far-sighted condition the natural shape of the lens is not exactly what it needs to be for the focal point to land directly on the retina and the adjustment that would be necessary to bring the light into focus on the retina exceeds the limitations of the ciliary muscles. (Note: It is a bit more complicated than implied here, because the cornea actually bends light more than the lens itself. MCAT questions tend to ignore that complication. It does make sense, however, because LASIK corrective surgery does nothing to your lens\u2014it reshapes your cornea!)

sVProvide a conceptual definition for the particle and wave models of light.
p1955
VThe wave model of light supposes that light is a wave. Young's Double Slit Experiment provides support for this model because only waves would show the diffraction and interference patterns necessary to create the characteristic light and dark bands. Constructive interference explains the light bands and destructive interference explains the dark bands. Constructive interference leads to addition of the amplitudes and thus greater intensity and greater brightness. Destructive interference leads to cancellation of the amplitudes and thus zero amplitude, or no light. The particle model of light supposes that light is a particle. The photoelectric effect is the major support for this model. The two are reconciled by quantum mechanics: photons are described by "wave functions" which sometimes act as macroscopic waves and sometimes as macroscopic particles.

sVWhat is the photoelectric effect and how does it relate to the particle model of light?
p3637
VThe photoelectric effect is the observation that electrons are ejected from a material when light of sufficiently high frequency is used\u2014but not until a threshold frequency is reached. Einstein first published an explanation for these observations in the context of the particle nature of light. If light were purely a conventional wave, increasing the amplitude sufficiently high would always result in ejection of an electron\u2014which is not seen. Instead, we observe that the energy of each individual photon (set by its frequency) must itself be high enough for an electron to be ejected. There is a one-to-one correspondence between photons and electrons.

sVWave Characteristics\u000a\u000aProvide conceptual definitions for each of the following variables used to describe waves: wavelength, period, velocity, amplitude, frequency, intensity, and phase.
p3813
VFor a simple sinusoidal wave, the wavelength (units = meters) is the distance between two adjacent crests (a.k.a., peaks, maxima), or between two adjacent troughs (a.k.a., valleys, minima). For a more complex wave, the wavelength is the distance between points where the wave begins to repeat itself. \u000a\u000aFor example, the wave used to represent heart rhythm has multiple peaks per cycle, so the distance between peaks would NOT be the wavelength. The period is the amount of time required for one full wavelength to pass a fixed point (units = seconds). The frequency is the number of wavelengths that pass a fixed point each second (units = 1/s or s-1 or Hertz [Hz]). Period and frequency are always inverses of each other. Velocity is how fast the wave moves in space in m/s. It is given by v = fw. \u000a\u000aThe time that passes between crests is the period. The number of crests that pass per second is the frequency\u000a\u000aAmplitude is the "distance" between the equilibrium point and a crest, or between the equilibrium point and a trough. (Distance is in quotes because the units of amplitude are not necessarily meters. They would be, for a wave on a rope, but not, for example, for a voltage wave or the electric field component of a light wave. Those would have units of volts or volts/m, respectively.) It is NOT the total distance between crest and trough! That would be twice the amplitude. \u000a\u000aAmplitude is the distance the wave rises above OR below the middle of the waveform. It is NOT the total distance from the bottom of a valley to the top of a crest (it would be half that).\u000a\u000aIntensity is a measure of power per unit area. Waves have power because they transport energy from one point to another in a given amount of time. Intensity is proportional to the square of the amplitude and the square of the frequency. Phase is a relative measure of how closely two waves (typically with the same frequency) are oriented to one another in space, typically expressed in radians or degrees. \u000a\u000a'Two waves that are "in phase" should cross the x-axis at the same point, but may have different amplitudes.

sVThis is a circular motion problem. There is a swing with a central shaft, and rod, with a rope attached to that. You are given a rod distance, a rope distance and an angle (theta) as the rope swings in a circle. You must draw the free body diagram, find the time of one revolution given the angle, and answer if the angle depends on the weight of the passenger.
p4075
VFirst find the total radius with trig. \u000a\u000aYour free body diagram has one downward force (force of gravity, mg), and the tension is split into one upward Ty and one inward Tx. You set the upward Ty equal to the downward force of gravity and solve for T. Then you plug that into the inward Tx definition. That is the force causing movement, or F=ma. So You can solve for acceleration by setting the inward force equal to mass times acceleration. \u000a\u000aThen you can solve for velocity using your acceleration in the circular acceleration formula. \u000a\u000aThen you plug velocity and radius into the revolution formula to find how much time it takes for one revolution to go around. \u000a\u000aThe mass cancels out when you do the problem. \u000a\u000a(You must find the value of sin(30).

p5215
VAll instruments have finite precision that limits the ability to resolve small measurement differences. For instance, a meter stick cannot distinguish distances to a precision much better than about half of its smallest scale division (0.5 mm in this case). One of the best ways to obtain more precise measurements is to use a null difference method instead of measuring a quantity directly. Null or balance methods involve using instrumentation to measure the difference between two similar quantities, one of which is known very accurately and is adjustable. The adjustable reference quantity is varied until the difference is reduced to zero. The two quantities are then balanced and the magnitude of the unknown quantity can be found by comparison with the reference sample. With this method, problems of source instability are eliminated, and the measuring instrument can be very sensitive and does not even need a scale.

p7095
VSee the diagram below: Ray P is an incident ray, Ray Q is a refracted ray, and Ray R is a reflected ray. The angle deta1 is always exactly equal to the angle deta3. The angles deta1 and deta2 are related to one another according to Snell's Law. Based on the direction of refraction alone, we know that n1 < n2. Because light waves travel faster in less dense mediums, we also know that v1 > v2. If we were to assume that the end of the blue shaded region represents the end of that medium, and that the white region below it represents a return to the same medium in which Rays P and R are traveling, then a continuation of Ray Q through this interface would create a newly refracted ray, Ray S. Ray S would be parallel to, but not continuous with, Ray P.

p8981
VGravitational potential energy is energy an object possesses because of its position in a gravitational field. The most common use of gravitational potential energy is for an object near the surface of the Earth where the gravitational acceleration can be assumed to be constant at about 9.8 m/s2. Since the zero of gravitational potential energy can be chosen at any point (like the choice of the zero of a coordinate system), the potential energy at a height h above that point is equal to the work which would be required to lift the object to that height with no net change in kinetic energy. It is negative.

VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

VRefrigerant is used to remove heat energy from inside of the refrigerator, then it travels outside the refrigerator where it releases the heat energy to the atmosphere\u000a1. Refrigerant absorbs heat energy from inside the refrigerator and lowers the temperature of the interior\u000a2. Refrigerant increases in temp and becomes vapor, it is then compressed and the compressor does work on the gas (system) adiabatic process increases internal energy and pressure, therefore temp\u000a3. The refrigerant moves outside and releases heat energy to the surrounding air\u000a4. The refrigerant becomes a liquid and enters the refrigerator again. IT enters and expansion valve, expands without absorbing heat, does work, and moves from high pressure region to low pressure region as its volume increases.

p10429
V-an object in free-fall experiences constant acceleration if air resistance is negligible.\u000a-on earth, all free-falling objects have an acceleration due to gravity, which averages \u000ag = 9.80 m/s^2\u000a- whether the acceleration should be taken as +g or -g is determined by your choice of coordinate system. If you choose the upward direction as positive, a = -g = -9.8 m/s^2 is negative. In the oppisite case, a = +g = 9.8 m/s^2 is positive. Since acceleration is constant, the kinematic equations above can be applied with the appropriate +g or -g substituted for a.\u000a-For objects in free-fall, up is normally taken as positive for displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

p10647
VAll objects have one or more natural frequencies at which they will vibrate when disturbed. Some objects produce a random array of different vibrational frequencies. Other objects (ex. musical instruments) vibrate at non-random natural frequencies which are integer multiples of a number (ex. 200 Hz , 400Hz, 600Hz, 800Hz). These orderly frequencies are called harmonics. When one object is vibrating near another object it can cause the neighboring object to begin vibrating at that same frequency. If the exact frequency at which the second object is caused to vibrate happens to be one of its natural frequencies (ex. harmonics), the two objects are said to be in resonance and via constructive interference can produce a much louder sound. If the first object causes a vibration in the second object that is NOT a match to one of its natural frequencies, resonance does not occur.

In 1999, another cesium-133 atomic clock was adopted, the atomic fountain clock, which, as the name implies , is based on the radiation frequency of a fountain of cesium atoms rather than a beam. The variation of this "timepiece" is less than 1 s per 20 million years.)

sVHow does increasing or decreasing each of the following affect capacitance: plate area, plate thickness, distance between plates, strength of the dielectric and voltage.
p10945
VIncreasing plate area increases capacitance because there is more room available on the inside surface of the plate to store electrons. Electrons do not line up on the sides or back of the plate, so increasing plate thickness will have no effect on capacitance. Increasing the distance between the plates increases voltage for a given Q on the plates, which decreases capacitance according to C = Q/V. Increasing the strength of the dielectric increases capacitance because the dielectric impedes the buildup of the electric field between the plates and diverts some of the capacitor's finite energy storage capacity to realign dipoles inside the dielectric. Increased voltage, increases the charge stored but does not increase capacitance, which is the charge stored per voltage.

p10979
VSee the diagrams on the following page. Some of the refraction angles may be exaggerated to make the direction of refraction clear. Students may be surprised by the two scenarios in which the light does not bend back to a line that is parallel with the incident ray. This occurs because the first refraction sends the light onto a surface that is perpendicular to the original interface. The entering and exiting rays will ONLY be parallel to one another if the two interfaces are also parallel to one another. If these cubes had been rectangles tall enough that the refracted ray always hit the opposite side, the normal pattern of parallel entry and exit would have been observed.

sVIn a lecture demonstration, a 3.0-m-long vertical string with ten bolts tied to it at equal intervals is dropped from the ceiling of the lecture hall. The string falls on a tin plate, and the class hears the clink of each bolt as it hits the plate. The sounds will not occur at equal time intervals. Why? Will the time between clinks increase or decrease near the end of the fall? How could the bolts be tied so that the clinks occur at equal intervals?
p13717
VThe time between clinks gets smaller and smaller. The bolts all start from rest and all have the same acceleration, so at any moment in time, they will all have the same speed. However, they have different distances to travel in reaching the floor and therefore will be falling for different lengths of time. The later a bolt hits, the longer it has been accelerating and therefore the faster it is moving. The time intervals between impacts decrease since the higher a bolt is on the string, the faster it is moving as it reaches the floor. In order for the clinks to occur at equal time intervals, the higher the bolt, the further it must be tied from its neighbor. Can you guess the ratio of lengths?

sVProvide conceptual definitions for both point charge and constant electric fields.
p14989
VA point charge field is an electric field created by a point charge. The strength of the electric field varies with the distance r from the point charge. A constant electric field, as the name implies, is constant and its strength does not vary with distance. Be aware that the MCAT tends to use the variable r for distance when discussing point charges and the variable d for distance when discussing constant electric fields (a.k.a., uniform electric fields). A constant electric field exists between the two plates of a parallel plate capacitor. Notice in the diagram above that although the electric field is constant at any point between the plates (recall that closer lines represent a stronger field), voltage is NOT constant. We've seen quite a few students confuse this point. The equipotential lines show that voltage is constant if you move parallel to the\u000aplates, but not if you move perpendicular to the plates.

VIf you forget which lens is which, you can always figure it out by employing the "packets of light" visualization. Recalling that light going through the lens will be slower than the light going through the air surrounding it, simply predict which way a light ray will bend near the top of the lens and near the bottom of the lens. This will reveal whether the lens diverges or converges light. The MCAT loves to throw curve balls. What if they presented you with a scenario where a lens was submerged in a fluid with an index of refraction greater than that of the lens? Suddenly your memorized rules for converging and diverging lenses would be out the window. If, however, you had learned via a method such as this to conceptualize how photons actually behave at any boundary, such a question would not be any more difficult for you than one given in the traditional format.

When making a measurement with a micrometer, electronic balance, or an electrical meter, always check the zero reading first. Re-zero the instrument if possible, or measure the displacement of the zero reading from the true zero and correct any measurements accordingly. It is a good idea to check the zero reading throughout the experiment.

VFirst, make a situational diagram. Checked that the angle theta you are solving for was between the force (the tension) and the direction of movement. So, you are able to use W = F*d*cos(theta). Solve for cos(theta) by moving all known values to one side of the equation (in this case that means dividing work over (tension times distance). You find the inverse cosine (cos^-1 = 2nd+cos button on calculator) of your variables plugged in, and that gives you the angle.

p17093
VA rocket can lift off from a launch pad only when it expels gas out of its engine. The rocket pushes on the gas, and the gas in turn pushes on the rocket. The whole process is very similar to riding a skateboard. Imagine that a skateboard and rider are in a state of rest (not moving). The rider jumps off the skateboard. In the third law, the jumping is called an action. The skateboard responds to that action by traveling some distance in the opposite direction. The skateboard's opposite motion is called a reaction. When the distance traveled by the rider and the skateboard are compared, it would appear that the skateboard has had a much greater reaction than the action of the rider. This is not the case. The reason the skateboard has traveled farther is that it has less mass than the rider.

sVProvide a conceptual definition for the following terms: refraction, reflection, diffraction and dispersion. How does dispersion account for the behavior of light passing through a prism?
p17593
VRefraction is the bending of light at an interface between two mediums with different indices of refraction. \u000a\u000aReflection is the bouncing of a wave off of an interface between two mediums. \u000a\u000aDiffraction is the bending of a wave around a corner or obstacle. \u000a\u000aDispersion is a change in index of refraction based on the frequency (or wavelength) of a wave. In a material with dispersion, different frequencies (or wavelengths) will be refracted to different angles, for the same incident angle. \u000a\u000aThe classic example of dispersion is white light passing through a prism. For visible light traveling through glass, longer wavelengths have smaller indices of refraction and therefore bend less than smaller wavelengths. This means red light bends the least, and violet light bends the most. This difference in refraction separates the white light into its colored components and produces a rainbow.

p18171
VThese are all relative terms. A conductor is a material that allows the flow of electrons through it relatively unimpeded. A resistor is a material that tends to impede the flow of electrons. This being said, even the best conductors do exhibit some small degree of resistance to the flow of electrons (superconductors being the possible exception), and all resistors do conduct electrons to some small degree. \u000aAn insulator is a material with a very, very high resistivity. There is no perfect ideal insulator that allows zero current flow under all conditions. However, materials like glass and Teflon allow negligible current flow up to extremely high voltages. A semiconductor is a material thought to be right in the middle of an insulator and a conductor (in terms of conductivity vs. resistivity). A superconductor is a material that under very precise conditions is thought to exhibit zero resistance to electron flow.

sVThe problem is set on another planet. You are given the mass of an item and you are given a height where it is dropped from and the time it takes to reach the ground. You are also given the circumference of the planet (which needs to be converted to meters). You are told to find the mass of the planet.
p21613
VWith the givens, you plugged in the distance the wrench fell, the starting velocity (zero because it was dropped from rest), and the time it took to fall into the distance equation (kinematics). This is done to find the acceleration due to gravity on this planet. With the acceleration due to gravity value, it is used to find the force of gravity on the wrench on this planet (its weight). This new force of gravity is plugged into the forces of gravity between two masses equation. You need the radius value, so using the circumference equation (where two times pi times radius is equal to the circumference), you find the radius. Then you plug that into the force of gravity equation. And then you plug in the first mass, which is the mass of the wrench and multiply it by the gravitational constant (6.67x10^-11), and solve for the second mass, which is the mass of the planet.

V-to solve problems involving Newton's laws of motion, follow the procedure described:\u000a1. draw a sketch of the problem\u000a2. identify known and unknown quantities, and identify the system of interest. Draw a free-body diagram. If vectors act in directions that are not horizontal or vertical, resolve the vectors into horizontal and vertical components and draw them on the free-body diagram\u000a3. write Newton's second law in the horizontal and vertical directions and add the forces acting on the object. If the object does not accelerate in a particular direction the net force (horizontal) = 0. if the object does accelerate in that direction, net force (horizontal) = ma\u000a4. check your answer.

sVWave Characteristics\u000a\u000aWhich of the above variables must be shared by two waves in order for those waves to have the same phase?
p23753
VIn order to be 100% in phase, two waves would have to have the same frequency, wavelength, and timing of maxima/minima (which could be done if they share the same time/place of origin). The latter is important because two waves might share the first two variables in common and would therefore be in phase if started from the same point, but would NOT be in phase if started from that same point 2 seconds apart. If they shared frequency and wavelength they would, by definition, share the same velocity. \u000a\u000aThey do NOT have to share amplitude to be in phase, and therefore intensity can also be different between two waves that are in phase. Also by definition, if they share the same frequency they must share the same period.

sVSuppose a disk rotates at constant angular velocity. Does a point on the rim have radial and/or tangential acceleration? If the disk's angular velocity increases uniformly, does the point have radial and/or tangential acceleration?
p24019
VIf a disk rotates at constant angular velocity, a point on the rim has radial acceleration only - no tangential acceleration. If the disk's angular velocity increases uniformly, the point will have both radial and tangential acceleration. If the disk rotates at constant angular velocity, neither component of linear acceleration is changing - both radial and tangential acceleration are constant. If the disk rotates with a uniformly increasing angular velocity, then the radial acceleration is changing, but the tangential acceleration is a constant non-zero value.

sVA big Misconception on Charge:
p24595
VWe have found many students who -- while working electricity problems -- conceptualize positive charges as tiny little masses with an inherent charge -- similar to an electron, just opposite in charge. What they are visualizing would essentially be a positron; which is indeed analogous to an electron, but opposite charge. Protons (although many, many times larger) also fit that concept. That being said, you should FORGET ABOUT POSITRONS AND PROTONS when it comes to circuits, electricity, current, etc. When we are are discussing electricity and circuits, positive charge is always a lack of electrons relative to being neutral where the proper number of electrons balances the stationary positive nuclei. There are NEVER actual positrons or protons moving around. It may be helpful to remember that outside of radioactive decay or atomic bombs, protons and positrons tend to stay on the nucleus! Of course, the hydrogen nucleus is just a single proton.

VOne reason that it is impossible to make exact measurements is that the measurement is not always clearly defined. For example, if two different people measure the length of the same rope, they would probably get different results because each person may stretch the rope with a different tension. The best way to minimize definition errors is to carefully consider and specify the conditions that could affect the measurement.

p27669
VThe letters AC in "AC Current" stands for "alternating current," and the letters DC in "DC Current" stand for "direct current." Direct current is about what it sounds like, the direct flow of current through a circuit from positive to negative (or in terms of electron flow from negative to positive). \u000a\u000aDC current is the kind of power used in automobiles because it comes directly from the battery. In fact, if something uses a battery you would be perfectly safe on the MCAT to assume that it must be an example of DC current. This would therefore include all automobile electronics, anything you plug into the cigarette lighter (unless it is an inverter of course), your cell phone (battery), etc. \u000a\u000aHousehold wiring utilizes AC current. Alternating current is also about what it sounds like\u2014both the polarity of the voltage and the direction of the current periodically reverse. A graph of current versus time for an AC current creates a sine wave.

p31781
Va) Current and electron flow are indicated below. We can determine both by simply looking at the orientation of the battery. The large line always represents the positive terminal. In this diagram the signs are shown, but they often are not. Electrons flow from the negative terminal to the positive, and current flows from the positive terminal to the negative. \u000a\u000ab) Current is the flow of electrons. Current cannot be intuited as a flow of positive charges from positive to negative as current is often defined. There are NO positive charges moving through the wires. The literal movement of charge is due entirely to moving electrons. In conceptual terms, this is the only way to think of and visualize current for the MCAT. This makes sense because we know that electrons congregated at a negative terminal on a battery do not like to be close to one another and will have potential energy that drives them to move toward the positive terminal. Just make it one of those important caveats that you keep close-at-hand that, in a totally counterintuitive way, someone defined the word "CURRENT" as flow in the exact opposite direction (positive to negative). Think of current as electrons, but remember the caveat.

sVExplain the terms "root mean square current" and "root-mean square voltage" as they apply to household AC current.
p32489
VThe "root mean square" (RMS) method of calculating both voltage and current are necessary for alternating current applications because the current and voltage over time are sinusoidal. This creates a problem because the average of a sine wave centered at the origin is zero. If you randomly sampled the voltage in your household wiring it could literally have a voltage of 120V one instant and a voltage of -120V the next instant. That would average to zero, even though the alternating current does deliver a continuously useful source of power (It can dissipate energy during both cycles). Power companies therefore use the RMS method to calculate the average power delivered to your home (otherwise, according to P = V2/R if V averages to zero you don't owe the power company anything!). RMS is just a mathematical calculation and it can be applied to voltage, current, to sine waves, or even to other waveforms such as square waves. To find RMS, you take readings at various time intervals, square all of those readings, take the average of those squares (i.e., the mean of the squares) and then take the square root of that average. You should understand this mathematical process for the MCAT as well as the general idea behind why it is necessary. \u000a\u000aIt would also be helpful to know that the rms voltage (or current) is equal to the equivalent DC voltage (or current) that would deliver the same amount of power.

sVif a baseball has a zero velocity at some instant, is the acceleration of the baseball necessarily zero at that instant?
p33739
VIf an object has zero velocity at some instant, its acceleration doesn't have to be zero. Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity over time. An object could be changing its direction and in doing so its velocity would instantaneously go to zero as it went from positive to negative or from negative to positive. If the velocity is changing it is accelerating. Therefore, it can be accelerating while its velocity is zero. An example would be a ball tied to an elastic. At first it is slowing down while traveling in the positive direction until it reaches zero velocity and then speeding up in the negative direction, all the while traveling with constant acceleration in the negative direction.

sVVisualize photons as physical packets of light!:
p34961
VEinstein's Nobel Prize-winning theory that light is made up of discreet, physical packets of energy called photons can be a tremendous aide to us in conceptualizing how light behaves at a boundary. Suppose we think of photons as little square packages. Visualize one of these packages striking a flat boundary at an angle. It is easy to visualize that one corner of our little "light package" will tend to pivot around the corner that is "stuck" in the higher-index medium. Without plugging anything into Snell's Law, or memorizing a rule about which scenario causes light to bend "toward the normal vs. away from the normal, " we can intuit exactly which way the light will bend.

sVWhat can be inferred about a material with an index of refraction of a) 0.9 and b) 1.5?
p35105
VThe index of refraction is a relative comparison of the speed of light in a vacuum (c) to the speed\u000aof light in that medium (v): n = c/v. Therefore, in order to get a value less than one, the speed of light in that medium would have to be greater than the speed of light in a vacuum which is only possible for circumstances beyond what the MCAT would be testing on. A value of 1.5 for n simply tells us that the medium has some density, and is more dense than air, which has a value for n that is very close to one.

sVCircuits\u000a\u000aExplain on the molecular level why increased temperature increases resistance.
p35551
VResistance on the molecular level is a function of the ability of the electron to travel in a free path between atoms. Electrons flow through conductors by striking an atom and thereby ejecting one of the other electrons from that same atom. This process of absorbing and ejecting electrons is the slowest part of the process (i.e., the rate-limiting step). Therefore, the more time the electrons spend in free space between atoms the less "impeded" they will be and the faster they will flow through the conduit. Increased temperature causes increased movement of the atoms in the conduit, increasing the average number of collisions an electron will have with atoms and therefore increasing resistance.

p38413
V-projectile motion is the motion of an object through the air that is subject only to the acceleration of gravity.\u000a-to solve projectile motion problems, perform the following steps:\u000a1.Determine a coordinate system. Then, resolve the position and/or velocity of the object in the horizontal and vertical components. The components of position are given by the quantities of x and y, and the components of the velocity are given by v(subscript x) = vcos\u03b8 and v(subscript y) = vsin\u03b8, where v is the magnitude of the velocity and \u03b8 is its direction.\u000a2. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the horizontal direction using the following equations:\u000aHorizontal motions [a(subscript x) = 0]\u000ax = x(initial) + v(sub x)t\u000av(sub x) = v(initial sub x) = v(sub x) = velocity is a constant\u000a3. Analyze the motion of the projectile in the vertical direction using the following equations:\u000aVertical motion (Assuming positive direction is up; \u000aa(sub y) = -g = -9.80 m/s^2)\u000ay = y(initial) + 1/2[v(initial sub y) + v(sub y)]t\u000av(sub y) = v(initial sub y) - gt\u000ay = y(initial) + v(initial sub y)t - 1/2gt^2\u000av(sub y)^2 = v(initial sub y)^2 - 2g[y - y(initial)]\u000a4. recombine the horizontal and vertical components of location and/or velocity using the following equations:\u000as = (square root) x^2 + y^2\u000a\u03b8 = tan ^-1 (y/x)\u000av = (square root) v(sub x)^2 + v(sub y)^2\u000a\u03b8(sub v) = tan^-1 [v(sub y)/v(sub x)]\u000a-The maximum height of a projectile launched with initial vertical velocity is given by\u000ah = v(inital vertical)^2/ 2g\u000a-The maximum horizontal distance traveled by a projectile is called the range. the range of a projectile on level ground launched at an angel \u03b8(initial) above the horizontal with initial speed is given by\u000aR = [v(inital)^2 sin2\u03b8(initial)] / g

p38883
VThe frequency will NOT change as the wave moves from one medium to another. We like to think of the frequency as the permanent "identifier" of a wave. For example, you will often hear waves referred to as "a 400Hz wave, a 200Hz wave, etc." This makes sense because the frequency stays the same as it passes through different mediums. \u000a\u000aThe wavelength, however, must change from medium to medium (assuming they have different densities) because we know that the velocity of electromagnetic waves does NOT remain constant from medium to medium\u2014it is generally higher in less dense mediums and lower in more dense mediums. According to v = fw if frequency remains constant and velocity changes, wavelength must change. Because velocity increases in low index mediums, wavelength must also increase in low index mediums.

p39089
VThis is a good test of how carefully you are thinking. You are a good portion of the way through the program and one of your primary goals should be to improve how carefully and analytically you think. The first thought most students will have is that if the source and observer are traveling at the same speed there will be no Doppler effect. This is TRUE, if\u2014and only if\u2014they are both traveling in the same direction (notice that we used the term speed, the scalar, not velocity, the vector). If they were traveling away from each other at identical speeds there would certainly be a Doppler shift.

sVCar A is traveling at 20 m/s toward car B and car B is traveling toward car A at 15 m/s. Car B honks its horn and car A perceives the frequency of that sound as f. After they pass on another, car B slows down to 5 m/s and honks its horn again. What must the motion of car A be at the moment in order for the perceived frequency of the second horn to equal f?
p39481
VThe original relative velocity described in the question was a 35m/s approach between source and observer. To match the exact frequency shift they must also be approaching one another at the same relative velocity in the second scenario. In the second scenario Car B is traveling 5 m/s away from car A, thus car A must turn around and travel TOWARD car B at a rate of 40m/s in order to experience the same perceived frequency from car B's horn. (This is the answer using our appropriate formulas; the "correct answer" using the full-fledged formulas will be quite close to that value, but far more difficult to obtain.)

p40049
V-Acceleration is defined as a change in velocity, meaning a change in its magnitude or direction, or both.\u000a-An external force is one acting on as system from outside the system, as opposed to internal forces, which act between components within the system.\u000a-Newton's second law of motion states that the acceleration of a system is directly proportional to and int he same direction as the net external force acting on the system, and inversely proportional to its mass.\u000a-in equation form:\u000aa = F(net) / m\u000aor\u000aF(net) = ma\u000a-the weight of an object is defined as the force of gravity acting on an object of mass. The object experiences an acceleration due to gravity:\u000aw = mg\u000a-if the only force acting on an object is due to gravity, the object is in free fall.\u000a-friction is a force that opposes the motion past each other of objects that are touching.

sVStanding Waves:
p42091
VThis is a special case of simultaneous constructive and destructive interference between two waves with identical frequencies moving through the same medium in opposite directions. At points of maximum destructive interference the waves cancel entirely to create a node. At points of maximum constructive interference the waves add completely to form an antinode. The result is a waveform in which the areas between the nodes appear to oscillate up and down between crests and troughs. A standing wave exhibits no net transport of energy and does not itself propagate. In other words, there is not translational movement of nodes or antinodes in either direction. By contrast, when a standard traveling wave propagates, the minima and maxima do move translationally in the direction of propagation.

p42867
Va) In order to use the right-hand "grip" rule for the direction of the B field created by a current- carrying wire with electrons moving from right to left across the page, we would first need to observe that if the electrons flow from right to left the current (i.e., conventional current; hypothetical movement of positive charges) must move from left to right. We place our thumb in the direction of the current (to the right) and our curled fingers represent the magnetic field. The field lines would therefore enter the page below the wire and circle around it to exit the page above the wire. If we viewed the wire in cross-section from the right end the magnetic field lines would be rotating counterclockwise; \u000a\u000ab) Using the version of the right-hand rule where the fingers represent the orientation of the magnetic field and the extended thumb represents the velocity vector, we would align our right hand upside down with fingers pointing to the right of the page (left to right). This would place our extended thumb out of the page (velocity vector) per the instructions. The question does not specify a positive or negative charge on the particle. If it is positively charged the force will be straight up in the plane of the page and if it is negatively charged it will be straight down in that same plane.

Inertia is related to an object's mass.\u000a- Mass, is the quantity of matter in a substance.

This acceleration is always in the direction of the net force. For any system of constant mass, a larger net force will produce a larger acceleration. With a given net force, the resulting acceleration will be less for a more massive object.

sVExplain why a pipe open at both ends gives all harmonics but a pipe open at one end and closed at the other gives only the odd harmonics. Use a diagram to illustrate your point.
p43689
VFor a pipe open at one end and closed at the other, the first harmonic features a node at one end and an antinode at the other. It is impossible to have a node at the open end of a pipe and impossible to have an antinode at the closed end of a pipe. (Speaking of displacement nodes/antinodes here, if you want to get technical.) These facts restrict the possible waveforms. The logical "next step," if you will, to move to the next harmonic from the first one is to add a node\u2014this is impossible, however, because it would require that there be nodes at both ends of the pipe. Thus, we skip this step and add one node and one antinode to get the third harmonic. Notice that this follows the general pattern explained in the lessons that each successive harmonic will have one additional node and one additional antinode. In the case of resonators with mixed ends, however, the "next" harmonic will be the next odd harmonic\u2014or the next possible harmonic given the limitations just described.

sVA common problem with manipulating equations using Ohm's Law:
p44479
VIt CANNOT be said that if voltage increases and current remains constant resistance will increase!!! \u000a\u000aResistance is a permanent quality of the resistor itself. Saying that increasing voltage will increase resistance is rather like saying that increasing force while acceleration is held constant will increase mass. Look again at the formula for resistance given earlier in this lesson. Notice that neither voltage nor current are in this equation. The only way to change the resistance is to either 1) physically remove one or more resistors from the circuit and replace them with other resistors that have different Ohms ratings, or 2) change the temperature of the resistor. If you were very careful you could say it this way: "If voltage increases, in order for current to remain constant I would need to increase the resistance." What will happen automatically if you increase voltage (without altering circuit components or temperature)? Current will simply increase.

sV4.5 Normal, Tension, and Other Examples of Forces
p45583
V-when objects rest on a surface, the surface applies a force to the object that supports the weight of the object. This supporting force acts perpendicular to and away from the surface. It is called normal force.\u000a-when objects rest on a non-accelerating horizontal surface, the magnitude of the normal force is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aN = mg\u000a-when objects rest on an inclined plane that makes an angle with the horizontal surface, the weight of the object can be resolved into components that act perpendicular and parallel to the surface of the plane. These components can be calculated using: \u000aw(parallel) = w sin(\u03b8) = mg sin(\u03b8)\u000aw(perpendicular) = w cos(\u03b8) = mg cos(\u03b8).\u000a-the pulling force that acts along a stretched flexible connector, such as a rope or cable, is called tension. When a rope supports the weight of an object that is at rest, the tension in the rope is equal to the weight of the object:\u000aT = mg\u000a-in any inertial frame of reference (one that is not accelerated or rotated), Newton's laws have the simple forms given and all forces are real forces having a physical origin

This creates a SEPARATION OF CHARGE and therefore a potential difference between terminals that will drive electron flow around the circuit to the positive terminal.\u000a\u000aAnything that separates charge creates a voltage and can therefore be thought of as a type of battery (and treated accordingly). A few former MCAT questions have involved very "non-traditional" batteries not easily recognized as such.

sVPerhaps surprisingly, a pattern of fringes can also be produced if the double-slit screen is replaced with a screen having only one slit. Provide possible explanations for this observation.
p47351
VWhen only a single slit is used, diffraction can still occur. One way of looking at this is through Huygen's Principle, which states that every point in the slit will act as a source of spherical waves. These waves interfere with each other just like the waves coming through each of the two slits in Young's experiment. However, the interference isn't as drastic as with a double-slit, and what results is a very bright central fringe and much lighter bands on either side.

sV1.2 Physical Quantities and Units
p47561
V-Physical quantities are a characteristic or property of an object that can be measured or calculated from other measurements.\u000a-Units are standards for expressing and comparing the measurement of physical quantities. All units can be expressed as combinations of four fundamental units.\u000a-The four fundamental units are the meter (for length), the kilogram (for mass), the second (for time), and the ampere (for electric current). These units are part of the metric system, which uses powers of 10 to relate quantities over the vast ranges encountered in nature\u000a-the four fundamental units are abbreviated as follows: meter, m; kilogram, kg; second, s; and ampere, A. The metric system also uses a standard set of prefixes to denote each order of magnitude greater than or lesser than the fundamental unit itself.\u000a-unit conversions involve changing a value expressed in one type of unit to another type of unit. This is done by using conversion factors, which are ratios relating equal quantities of different units.

p48075
Va) Accelerating the same trailer from 0 to 50m/s would represent the same amount of work. Doing so in half the time would represent twice the power. Truck A does have twice the power of Truck B, so this is true. \u000a\u000ab) According to KE = 1/2mv2, twice as much energy would be required to accelerate at trailer twice as massive to the same speed. If this is accomplished in the same period of time, twice the power will be required. Truck A does have twice the power, so this statement is also true. \u000a\u000ac) Accelerating a trailer to twice the velocity will actually require four times the energy due to the square on velocity in the KE equation. Therefore, Truck A cannot accomplish this task and this answer is false.

p48091
VSome measuring devices require time to reach equilibrium, and taking a measurement before the instrument is stable will result in a measurement that is generally too low. The most common example is taking temperature readings with a thermometer that has not reached thermal equilibrium with its environment. A similar effect is hysteresis where the instrument readings lag behind and appear to have a "memory" effect as data are taken sequentially moving up or down through a range of values. Hysteresis is most commonly associated with materials that become magnetized when a changing magnetic field is applied.

VMany free-response questions are divided into parts such as a, b, c, and d, with each part calling for a different response. Credit for each part is awarded independently, so you should attempt to solve each part. For example, you may receive no credit for your answer to part a, but still receive full credit for part b, c, or d. If the answer to a later part of a question depends on the answer to an earlier part, you may still be able to receive full credit for the later part, even if that earlier answer is wrong.

VWhen an object falls under gravity, Earth exerts a net force on it, so by the Third Law the object exerts an equal and opposite force on the earth. However, the earth doesn't move perceptibly because the object's mass is extremely small compared to the Earth, and the Second Law states that heavier objects require more force than lighter objects to move or accelerate them. As a result, an extremely large force would need to be exerted on the earth to perceptibly move it out of the sun's gravitational pull.

The 1st overtone is NOT the same as the 1st harmonic!!!!! The first harmonic is called the fundamental frequency, the second harmonic is called the 1st overtone, the third harmonic is called the 2nd overtone, and so forth.\u000a\u000aFor oscillators with matching ends, the wavelength of the second harmonic equals the length of the string pipe (w=L)\u000a\u000aw= wavelength\u000a\u000aThe fundamental harmonic is when the length of the string exactly fits half of a wavelength (two nodes with a single antinode in between.) The second harmonic is when the length of the string fits a full wavelength (an additional antinode and node). The third harmonic is when the length of the string fits one and a half wavelengths (yet another additional antinode and node). To fit the additional nodes/antinodes in each successive harmonic, the wavelength MUST be shrinking. Frequency will also follow a simple relationship: the frequency of the second harmonic is twice that of the first harmonic, the third is three times the first harmonic, etc.

sV4.7 Further Applications of Newton's Laws of Motion
p50641
V-Newton's laws of motion can be applied in numerous situations to solve problems of motion.\u000a-some problems will contain multiple force vectors acting in different directions on an object. Be sure to draw diagrams, resolve all force vectors into horizontal and vertical components, and draw a free-body diagram. Always analyze the direction in which an object accelerates so that you can determine whether net force = ma or net force = 0.\u000a-the normal force on an object is not always equal in magnitude to the weight of the object. If an object is accelerating, the normal force will be less than or greater than the weight of the object. Also, if the object is on an inclined plane, the normal force will always be less that the full weight of the object.\u000a-some problems will contain various physical quantities, such as forces, acceleration, velocity, or position. You can apple concepts from kinematics and dynamics in order to solve these problems of motion.

For instance, you may inadvertently ignore air resistance when measuring free-fall acceleration, or you may fail to account for the effect of the Earth's magnetic field when measuring the field of a small magnet. The best way to account for these sources of error is to brainstorm with your peers about all the factors that could possibly affect your result. This brainstorm should be done before beginning the experiment so that arrangements can be made to account for the confounding factors before taking data. Sometimes a correction can be applied to a result after taking data, but this is inefficient and not always possible.

VVoltage = the amount of work necessary to move a charge against an electrical field. \u000a\u000aMoving the charge a longer distance against the field would require more work per unit charge, so that means more voltage. This aligns with the general observation that voltage increases with distance. If the electric field were stronger, moving a charge the same distance against the field would require more work per unit charge, so that would also mean more voltage. Both of these concepts are demonstrated in the two equations we've presented thus far for voltage: V=Ed and V=Kq/r (the second equation is also V= Ed, where E= Kq/r2 ; when multiplied by distance (r or d, it doesn't matter) one r is cancelled out leaving V=Kq/r).

sVIf 20 kg hangs exactly 3 meters from the fulcrum, what mass should hang on the other end, 5 meters from the fulcrum, balance the board?
p55153
VYou could solve this problem by setting torques clockwise equal to torques counterclockwise, but it would be better if you could look at this situation conceptually and use your knowledge of manipulating equations. T = Fl shows us that force and lever arm are inversely related. Therefore, if a mass is a factor of 5/3 farther from the fulcrum than is the first mass, then that mass will need to be 3/5 as large as the first mass. 20kg*3/5 = 12kg.

VIn classical mechanics, a harmonic oscillator is a system that, when displaced from its equilibrium position, experiences a restoring force, F, proportional to the displacement, x: where k is a positive constant. If F is the only force acting on the system, the system is called a simple harmonic oscillator, and it undergoes simple harmonic motion: sinusoidal oscillations about the equilibrium point, with a constant amplitude and a constant frequency. If a frictional force proportional to the velocity is also present, the harmonic oscillator is described as a damped oscillator. Depending on the friction coefficient, the system can: Oscillate with a frequency smaller than in the non-damped case, and an amplitude decreasing with time. Decay to the equilibrium position, without oscillations.

p56197
VEvaporation happens only at the surface of a liquid and occurs at any temperature (so long as the substance is a liquid at that temperature).\u000aLiquids evaporate faster at a higher temperature \u000a\u000aEvaporation happens because not all particles in the liquid are moving at the same speed and, as a result, the faster particles are more likely to overcome the forces they feel from their neighbors.\u000aThe particles at the surface of the liquid are only held in place by forces from the neighboring particles beneath them, whereas particles in the middle of the liquid have forces holding them on all sides. Thus, particles at the surface find it easier to break away from the liquid.\u000a\u000aBoiling happens throughout the liquid, usually starting from some site on the inside of the container and rising in a bubble to the surface. It only happens when the temperature is above the boiling point of that substance.\u000a\u000aBoiling occurs when the average motion of particles is fast enough to overcome the forces holding them close together. This happens evenly throughout a boiling liquid because the temperature is uniform throughout.

VFor waves passing from higher index mediums into lower index mediums, the critical angle is the angle of incidence for which the angle of refraction will be 90°. If this angle is exceeded, refraction ceases and all waves are reflected back into the more dense medium\u2014a phenomenon called "total internal reflection." Snell's Law can be used to solve for the critical angle by plugging in 90° for \u03982: n1sin\u03981 = n2sin\u03982 - --> n1sin\u03981 = n2sin90 --> sin\u03981 = n2/n1.

sV(a) What type of lens is found in the human eye? (b) In a magnifying glass? (Hint: It is NOT the one most people first assume.)
p56563
V(a) The lens of the human eye is a converging lens. It creates a real image of the object onto the retina. \u000a\u000a(b) A magnifying glass is also a converging lens. Most students assume it would be a diverging lens because the rays that are spreading apart might seem like they would make the image appear larger. This thinking reflects a misconception about where images are formed. Your eye does not capture divergent rays and form an image based on how far apart those rays are\u2014rather it traces those rays back to where it appears that the source of the rays would be. \u000a\u000aAlso note that in a magnifying glass we see an upright image\u2014even though converging lenses are said to create positive, real, INVERTED images. This is an example of the caveat given in bold in the lesson: When the object is inside the focal point it produces a negative, virtual, upright image. This is the case with a magnifying glass. In order to see the magnified image the object must be inside the focal point of the lens. This is also supported by the formula for magnification, which shows us that in order for the image to be magnified the distance between the object and the lens must be less than the distance between the observer (image) and the lens (M = -di/do).

VEnergy change in a system could be due to heat transfer as well. However, we have never seen the MCAT introduce this kind of heat on physics work and/or energy problems. They will expect you to know that non-conservative forces such as friction dissipate some energy as "heat", leaving less energy available to do work (ex. velocity of a ball at the bottom of an inclined plane is less with friction than without. This is because the energy dissipated to "heat" was not available to increase the KE of the ball). However, this use of the word "heat" refers to an increase in the internal energy of molecules, not the "heat transfer" (Q) included in the first law of thermodynamics (Change E= W +Q).

p58669
VInvolves resolving the vectors into rectangular vector components and adding the components for each axis independently. The sums of the x-and y-component vectors being added are equal to the corresponding vector components of the resultant vector to add. The same principle applies with 3 or more vectors. In adding vectors by the component method, all vectors will be referenced to the nearest x-axis= + or -x axis. In the component method, the vectors to be added are resolved into their x and y components, and the respective components added and then recombined to find the resultant.

p59267
VWe are pretending that the net forces acting from either side are equal. In reality, because the object is accelerating we know there is a net force and they are not equal. That net force is what causes the object to accelerate. By adding ma to the weaker side we are making them equal again. We use ma instead of using a variable like Fnet simply because we usually know the mass of the object and the acceleration of the system, but don't necessarily know the net force. Of course, you could solve by summing all forces to the net force, then substitute ma for that net force. Most classes teach this method, but then you must carefully track signs.
