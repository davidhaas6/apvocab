p2205
VIn 1919 Rutherford discovered that he could change one element into another by striking it with energetic alpha particles (which we now know are just helium nuclei). In the early 1920's Rutherford and other physicists made a number experiments, transmuting one atom into another. In every case, hydrogen nuclei were emitted in the process. It was apparent that the hydrogen nucleus played a fundamental role in atomic structure, and by comparing nuclear masses to charges, it was realized that the positive charge of any nucleus could be accounted for by an integer number of hydrogen nuclei. By the late 1920's physicists were regularly referring to hydrogen nuclei as 'protons'. The term proton itself seems to have been coined by Rutherford, and first appears in print in 1920.

sVWhen a 1.000 g sample of the rocket fuel hydrazine, N2H4, is burned in a bomb calorimeter which contains 1200 g of water, the temperature rises from 24.62°C to 28.16°C. If the C for the bomb is 840 J/°C, calculate\u000a\u000areaction for combustion of a one-gram sample\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aqreaction for combustion of one mole of hydrazine in the bomb calorimeter
p4713
Vor a bomb calorimeter, use this equation:\u000aqreaction = -(qwater + qbomb)\u000a\u000aqreaction = -(4.18 J / g·°C x mwater x \u0394t + C x \u0394t)\u000a\u000aqreaction = -(4.18 J / g·°C x mwater + C)\u0394t\u000a\u000awhere q is heat flow, m is mass in grams, and \u0394t is the temperature change. Plugging in the values given in the problem:\u000a\u000aqreaction = -(4.18 J / g·°C x 1200 g + 840 J/°C)(3.54°C)\u000a\u000aqreaction = -20,700 J or -20.7 kJ\u000ait basically broken up in water plus bomb calorimeter part \u000a\u000a\u000a now know that 20.7 kJ of heat is evolved for every gram of hydrazine that is burned. Using the periodic table to get atomic weights, we can calculate that one mole of hydrazine, N2H4, weight 32.0 g. Therefore, for the combustion of one mole of hydrazine:\u000aqreaction = 32.0 x -20.7 kJ/g\u000a\u000aqreaction = -662 kJ

VIf the volume is changed, Le Châtelier's Principle states that the reaction will shift in the direction that will minimize the effect of the increase in volume (the one with the greatest amount of moles). So, if a reactants volume is decreased, increasing the concentration, the reaction will go in the forward direction, thus increasing the driving force on the electrons, and the cell potential will increase. If one of the volumes is increased, decreasing the concentration, the forward reaction will be opposed, thus decreasing cell potential.

Qualitatively distinguishes fast from slow reactions.\u000aIdenti es the connection between less direct observations (intensity of color, color changes) made at the macroscopic level and the rate of an underlying reaction. Designs an experiment to measure the rate law of a reaction. Articulates the distinction and relation between the rate law and integrated rates, and uses these to determine rate laws from experimental data regarding either initial rates or concentration versus time data.

Vfor heat of solution calculations, the heat capacity of the calorimeter, also called the calorimeter constant, must be determined experimentally. The calorimeter constant has units J/oC. This calibration experiment is done by mixing equal volumes of hot and cool water in the calorimeter and measuring the temperature after 20 sec- onds. The resulting value is assumed to be the instantaneous mixing temperature, Tmix. The average temperature Tavg of the initial hot (TH) and cool water (TC) is also calculated:\u000aTavg = (TH + TC)/2

Also, we need to have the equation balanced, so be sure to remember to check for that. Fractional coefficients are OK.\u000aexample:\u000aC2H5OH(\u2113) + (7/2)O2(g) ---> 2CO2(g) + 3H2O(\u2113)\u000a\u000a\u0394H°comb = [ 2 (-393.5) + 3 (-286) ] minus [ (-278) + (7/2) (0) ]\u000aThe boldfaced values are the coefficients and the other ones are the standard enthalpy of formation for the four substances involved. Since oxygen is an element in its standard state, its enthalpy of formation is zero.\u000a\u000aDoing the math gives us \u0394H°comb = -1367 kJ/mol of ethyl alcohol.\u000a\u000aThe \u0394H°f values (-393.5, -286, -278 and zero) were looked up in a reference source.

V1. There is less electron-electron repulsion, so they can come closer together. \u000a2. Protons outnumber electrons; the protons can pull the fewer electrons toward the nucleus more tightly. \u000a3. If the electron that is lost is the only valence electron so that the electron configuration of the cation is like that of a noble gas, then an entire energy level is lost. In this case, the radius of the cation is much smaller than its respective atom.

Large radius anion = more polar and stronger acid. If an H-X Structure is such that X is a metal, then the H is negatively charged and the structure will behave as a proton acceptor or base. Non-polar H-X structures, like CH4, are neutral.\u000a\u000aBond Strength: If the H-Halide bond is strong, despite the fact that X is a metal, then the H is negatively charged and the structure will behave as a proton acceptor or base. Format is X-H.\u000a\u000aStability of the Conjugate base: An acid will be stronger and more likely to donate a proton as the conjugate base becomes more stable due to more O present in anion.

sVExplain how the dissociation of water establishes the pH scale.
p16013
V-the dissociation of water basically kicks out an H+ ion from one water molecule, and the H+ sticks to the other water molecule, forming H3O. That leaves an OH- just floating around. This establishes the pH scale because other molecules can compare the amounts of H+ ions and the amounts of OH- ions to the amounts of each in water. It is either acidic (having more H+ ions) or more basic (having more OH- ions).

p16353
Vstandard :this means a very specific temperature and pressure: one atmosphere and 25 °C (or 298 K). If a solution is being discussed, then everything in solution will be at a 1.00-molar concentration.\u000a\u000a this word means a substance, written as the product of a chemical equation, is formed DIRECTLY from the elements involved. The substance in question is always written with a coefficient of one. \u000a\u000akey points about standard enthalpy formation \u000aEvery substance is shown in its standard state. This is the physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) \u000aAn example: the enthalpy of formation for Br2 in its standard state is zero. The enthalpy of formation for Br (monoatomic gas) is 111.881 kJ/mol. This is because Br (monoatomic gas) is not bromine in its standard state. Only Br2 (diatomic liquid) is.\u000a(2) There is never a COMPOUND on the reactant side, only elements. What is being written is a formation reaction. Look again at the definition of formation. Here is an example of a chemical reaction that IS NOT a formation reaction:6CO2(g) + 6H2O(\u2113) ---> C6H12O6(s) + 6O2(g)\u000a\u000a3) Formation reactions sometimes are "fake" reactions, in that they cannot possibly happen as written. For example:\u000a\u000aH2(g) + O2(g) ---> H2O2(\u2113)\u000ais simply not possible. You can't make hydrogen peroxide by reacting hydrogen and oxygen directly. When you do that, you ALWAYS get water. Hydrogen peroxide is made a different way, but you can still write the formation reaction. And it is still useful, as you will see.

sVDescribe the function of enzymes, include the terms substrate, induced-fit model, active site. Are enzymes changed as a result of a reaction? What affects the efficiency of an enzyme? Also Describe the structure of enzymes and how they are regulated
p16487
Vthe active site is where the substrate attaches to the enzyme\u000aAs the substrate enters the active site, the enzyme changes shape slightly due to interactions between the substrate's chemical groups and chemical groups on the side chains of the amino acids that form the active site. This shape change makes the active site fit even more snugly around the substrate. This induced fit is like a clasping handshake. Enzymes regulate the rate of chemical reactions Enzymes are globular proteins that act as catalysts (activators or accelerators) for metabolic reaction. an enzyme is considered a catalyst because it speeds up chemical reactions without being used up. They are also considered specific because of their ability to recognize the shape of a particular molecule. An enzyme is unchanged as a result of a reaction. The efficiency of the enzyme is affected by temperature and pH. The induced fit model describes how enzymes work. Within the protein (the enzyme) there is an active site with which the reactants readily interact because of the shape polarity or the other characteristics of the active site.

sVAcid-Base Behavior: Oxyacids
p16689
VExamples of OxyAnions: HClO, HSO4\u000a\u000aIf you have a metal "Y" with a low EN bound to O-H, the structure will behave as a base. Example NaOH.\u000a\u000aIf "Y" is a nonmetal bound to an OH, as the EN of Y increases, the substance becomes a stronger acid-------------The reason for this is because as the electron cloud move closer to Y, the O-H bond becomes weaker and more polarized, which favors the loss of H+. Also, because the conjugate base of any acid YOH is usually an anion, the stability of the anion increases as the EN of Y increases and the loss of a proton is favored. \u000a\u000aIf Y-O-H contains more high EN atoms attached to U, the anion becomes more stable and the acid will become stronger.

p16719
VGases consist of large numbers of molecules that are in continuous, random motion; The combined volume of all the molecules of the gas is negligible relative to the total volume in which the gas is contained; attractive and repulsive forces between gas molecules are negligible; energy can be transferred between molecules during collisions, but the average kinetic energy of the molecules does not change with time, as long as the temperature of the gas remains constant; the average kinetic energy of the molecules is proportional to the absolute temperature. At any given temperature the molecules of all gases have the same average kinetic energy. This theory explains both pressure and temperature at the molecular level.

sVProblem with finding maximum work
p18413
VTo obtain electrical work, current must flow. When current flows, some energy is wasted through frictional heating, and the maximum work is not obtained. So, in any real spontaneous process, some energy is always wasted -- the actual work realized is always less than the calculated maximum. This can also be explained in terms of entropy, as the entropy of the universe in any spontaneous process must increase. The only process from which maximum work could be realized is a reversible one, which is impossible.

sVa) Describe why phospholipids are important components of cell membranes, based on their structure and properties.\u000ab) Explain why proteins are an important component of the cell membrane, based on their structure and properties.
p22047
Va.) A phospholipid molecule contains a hydrophilic "head" and two hydrophobic fatty acid tails. In cell membranes, surfaces, phospholipids are arranged in a bilayer in which the hydrophilic heads are in contact with the cell's watery interior and exterior whereas the tails are pointed away from water and toward each other in the interior of the membrane. The fatty acid chains of phospholipids can contain double bonds which make them unsaturated. Because of the kinks in the tails, phospholipids aren't packed together tightly, which contributes tot he fluidity of the membrane. The fluidity of the cell membrane is very important in its function; the less fluid the membrane is, the more impermeable it is. There is an optimum permeability for the cell membrane at which all the substances necessary for metabolism can pass into and out of the cell. The fluidity of cell membranes enables hydrophobic molecules such as hydrocarbons, carbon dioxide, and oxygen to dissolve in the bilayer and easily cross teh membrane. However, ions and polar molecules (including water, glucose, and other sugars) cannot readily pass through because of the hydrophobic interior. Protein channels and transport proteins allow these required substances to cross membranes\u000a2.) There are numerous functions of proteins in the membrane. One important function is tahat some proteins protrude on the extracellular side of the membrane and serve as receptors for signaling molecules. A second function is seen with proteins that extend through the interior of the bilayer and serve as channels for the passage of molecules or ions that cannot pass through the phospholipids.

p22343
VFunctional Groups are specific structures that have specific chemical reactions.\u000aHydroxyl: -OH. The hydroxyl groups are alcohols and since hydroxyl is polar, it increases solubility because H+ bonds with water.\u000aCarbonyl: -CO- (Ketone) or COH (Aldehyde). The Carbonyl group is polar and makes it very soluble. Carbonyl groups are found in sugars (ketose and aldose)\u000aCarboxyl: COOH or COO-. Carboxyl groups are found in cells in the ionized form with a charge of 1- and called a carboxylate ion. It has acidic properties as the H+ is easily donated.\u000aAmino: -NH2 and -NH3+. The Amino group acts as a base and will accept H+.\u000aSulfhydryl: -SH. 2 Sulfhydryl groups can react forming a covalent bond (disulfide bridge), and this helps protein structure.\u000aPhosphate: PO42-. Phosphate is found in DNA, and gives a negative charge to the molecule it is a part of. Has potential to react with H2O.\u000aMethyl: -CH3. Methyl deactivates DNA when attached.

p23815
VA suspension of tiny particles in some medium. The suspended particles are single large molecules or aggregates of molecules or ions ranging in size from 1 to 1000 nm. These are classified according to the states of the dispersed phase and the dispersing medium.\u000aThese are electrically neutral. However, when it is placed in an electric field,the dispersed particles all migrate to the same electrode and thus must all have the same charge. The center of a colloidal particle (a tiny ionic crystal, a group of molecules, or a single large molecule) attracts from the medium a layer of ions, all of the same charge. This group of ions, in turn, attracts another layer of oppositely charged ions. Because the colloidal particles all have an outer layer of ions with the same charge, they repel each other and do not easily aggregate to form particles that are large enough to precipitate.

VA liquid-liquid solution that obeys Raoult's law\u000aNearly ideal behavior is often observed when the solute-solute, solvent-solvent, and solute-solvent interactions are very similar. In solutions where the solute and solvent are very much alike, the solute simply acts to dilute the solvent. However, if the solvent has a special affinity for the solute, such as hydrogen bonding, the tendency of the solvent molecules to escape will be lowered more than expected. The observed vapor pressure will be lower than the value predicted by Raoult's law; there will be a negative deviation from Raoult's law.

sVWhy Enzymes denature at high temperatures, or wrong pHs?
p26989
V- Enzymes are proteins, meaning that they are strings of amino acids connected together by peptide bonds that form a certain structure. Proteins have several different structures in how they may exist - primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. The primary structure of a protein is just the linear sequence of amino acids. The secondary structure involves hydrogen bonding between amino acids. The tertiary structure involves bonding between R-groups and the quaternary structure usually involves multiple protein interactions. Denaturing at high temperatures occurs because high temperatures rupture some of the bonding that occurs in these quaternary/tertiary/and secondary protein structures. Once these bonds are broken, the enzyme (protein) is reduced to its primary structure with just peptide bonds occurring - the functional structure of the enzyme is lost and it is no longer functional. This works for most proteins. In the case of the enzyme, however, when the structure is lost, the active site and allosteric site also lose their functionality and therefore no substrate may bind to the enzyme\u000a- H ions have a positive charge which means that they are attracted to the negative parts of certain molecules (or negative ions).An enzymes tertiary structure is held in place by a number of ionic and hydrogen bonds. These bonds help to ensure that the active site of the enzyme is held in the right shape. These bonds occur because of the attraction between oppositly charged groups on the amino acids that make up the enzyme protein.Because of the charge of the H+ ions, they are able to interfere with the hydrogen bonds and the ionic bonds that are holding the enzymes tertiary structurre in place. This means that increasing or decreasing the concentration of hydrogen ions in a soluition around an enzyme ( changing the pH of the solution) can alter the tertiary structure of the enzyme molecule. So changes in pH can also cause changes to the shape of the active site, therefore denaturing it.

p27399
VWhen one analyzes the strength of acids with anions from the same group, bond strength is the major factor.\u000a\u000aAs the anion radius gets larger, The H-X Bond gets weaker and the acid becomes stronger. Smaller radius=larger electronegativity.\u000a\u000aBond polarity is the major factor that determines the strength of binary acids when the anions are in the asme period. As EN increases across a period, The H-X anion bond gets more polarized and the acid becomes stronger. Exception of NH3 bc it acts as a base.

VIn which order will the metals be plated out onto the cathode as the voltage is gradually increased? The most positive E° value will correspond to the reaction that has a tendency to proceed in the direction indicated. So, the substance with the greatest reduction potential will be plated out first. This does not work always, though. For instance, with water, its more positive potential would cause O2 to be produced at the anode because it is easier to oxidize H2O. However, this doesn't happen because, as the voltage is increased, the other ion will be the first to oxidize. This occurs because the voltage required in excess of the expected value (overvoltage) is much greater for the production of O2 than for the other.

sVWhy does water melt at 10°C but freeze at -10°C?
p28573
V\u2206Ssurr and \u2206S oppose each other. \u2206S favors melting because of the positional entropy and the increase thereof because of increased amount of positions, but \u2206Ssurr favors freezing because of the exothermic process that takes place during freezing. So, at temperatures less than 0°C, freezing will be favored, because \u2206Ssurr is large in magnitude than \u2206S. Above 0°C, \u2206S (melting) will be favored, since \u2206S is larger than \u2206Ssurr. At 0°C, the opposing tendencies balance, so the system is at equilibrium.

sVWhy do hydrogen bonds cause high specific heat? Also include why water has a high heat of vaporization
p29899
V- Much of the heat absorbed by water is used to break hydrogen bonds. Only a small amount of heat is left over to increase molecular motion. Since temperature measures molecular motion, the temperature rises only slightly. Molecules that don't make hydrogen bonds, like CO2, attract each other more weakly, so a larger fraction of absorbed heat can raise the temperature. Also each water molecule can make up to 4 hydrogen bonds \u000a- Boiling occurs when all the water molecules have so much energy that their motions break most of the hydrogen bonds. Then the liquid rapidly changes to gas bubbles (steam). If you keep adding heat to boiling water, the temperature stays the same because all the heat is used to break hydrogen bonds. The free molecules (steam) carry away energy.

sVRules for naming anions
p30039
V1. The names of monoatomic anions are formed by replacing the ending of the element with -ide. Ex: H- (hydride ion), O2- (oxide ion). Several polyatomic anions also end with -ide, such as OH- (hydroxide ion), CN- (cyanide ion), and O22- (peroxide ion).\u000a2. For oxyanions, an -ate is added to the end to represent the most common ionic form. An -ite is added to indicate that the oxyanion has the same charge but one fewer oxygen molecule. Ex: NO3- (nitrate ion) vs. NO2- (nitrite ion).\u000a3. When there are four types of oxyanions for an element, the prefix per- is added to indicate one more O atom than the oxyanion ending in -ate, and the prefix hypo- is added to indicate one O atom fewer than the -ite oxyanion. For example, ClO4- is perchlorate ion, ClO3- is chlorate ion, ClO2- is chlorite ion, and ClO- is hypochlorite ion.\u000a4. When H+ is added to an anion, hydrogen or dihydrogen is added to the beginning. Ex: HCO3- is hydrogen carbonate

sVManipulations needed to combine oxidation-reduction reactions
p30175
VOne of the reduction half-reactions must be reversed (since redox reaction must involve a substance being oxidized and a substance being reduced). The half-reaction with the largest positive potential will run as written (as a reduction), and the other half-reaction will be forced to run in reverse (as an oxidation). The net potential of the cell will be the difference between the two. Since the reduction process occurs at the cathode and the oxidation process occurs at the anode, E°cell = E°cat - E°ano\u000a\u000aAnd, since the number of electrons lost must equal the number gained, the half-reactions must be multiplied by integers as necessary to achieve the balanced equation. However, upon doing this, the value of E° is not changed when a half-reaction is multiplied by an integer. Since a standard reduction potential is an intensive property (it does not depend on how many times the reaction occurs), the potential is not multiplied by the integer required to balance the cell reaction.

sVEssay Question: This question concerns the chemistry of the Group 13 elements (B-TI) Base your answers on the principles of atomic structure and bonding.\u000a\u000aa. the first ionization energies (IE) of most main group elements decrease steadily upon descending the family whereas the first (IE) B-Tl are [B 801, Al 578, Ga 579, In 558, Tl 589] KJ.mol^-1\u000a\u000ai.Explain briefly why the IEs for most families decrease steadily upon descending family\u000a\u000aii. suggest a reason that the IE for Ga is essentially the same as that for Al and the IE for Tl is greater that for In \u000a\u000ab. The member for this family exhibit oxidation states of +1 and/or +3 \u000a\u000ai. account for the fact that the stable oxidation states are +1 and +3 and a +2 oxidation state is not observed \u000aii. account for the fact that B and Al show the +3 oxidation state exclusively while the +3 state for Tl is strong oxidizing agent\u000a\u000ac. BCl3 and AlCl3 are strong Lewis Acids\u000a\u000ai. write an equation to illustrate BCl3 acting as a Lewis acid with an appropriate Lewis base. Explain occurs in a Lewis acid-base reaction\u000aii. account for the fact that the Lewis Acidity of the other tri-chlorides decreases down the family
p30245
Va.\u000ai. when you descend families on the periodic table, the ionization of the electron occurs from higher n values that are (usually) further from the nucleus \u000a\u000aii. the 3d subshell fills just before Ga. There is no 2d subshell to fill prior to Al. The 10 added protons are not completely screened by the 10 d electrons, resulting in higher effective nuclear charge and smaller radius than expected for Ga, hence a higher IE than expected. For Tl, the newly added subshell is the 4f subshell, and a similar effect observed \u000a\u000ab.\u000ai. The +1 ion corresponds

sVProduction of Aluminum, Hall-Heroult Process
p31167
VA practical electrolytic process for producing aluminum involving molten cryolite (Na3AlF6) as the solvent for aluminum oxide. Electrolysis is only possible if ions can move to the electrodes, and this is usually obtained by dissolving the substance in water. This can't be done with Al because water is more easily reduced than Al (reduction potentials). Ion mobility, though, can also be produced by melting the salt, but Al's melting point is far too high. But, mixing it with molten cryolite brings it down to 1000°C. Thus, Al can be obtained electrolytically. However, bauxite is not pure aluminum oxide, as it also contains the oxides of iron, silicon, and titanium. So, to obtain aluminum oxide, the bauxite must be treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide. Alumina dissolves in basic solution, as it is amphoteric. The other metal oxides, which are basic, will remain solid. Then, the aluminate ion solution is separated from the other oxides and is acidified with carbon dioxide gas, causing the alumina to re-precipitate. Then, the purified alumina is mixed with the cryolite and melted, and the Al ion is reduced to Al metal in an electrolytic cell.

sVCorrosion of Iron
p33177
VThe corrosion of iron is an electrochemical reaction, not a direct oxidation process as we might expect. This is called the corrosion mechanism. Also, steel is not completely homogeneous in its chemical composition. Physical strains can leave stress points in the metal, as well. So, these are areas where the iron is more easily oxidized, and are thus called anodic regions. The areas were oxidation does not occur as easily are cathodic regions. \u000aAnodic region: Fe --> Fe2+ + 2e- \u000aThe electrons released will flow through the steel, just like a wire in a galvanic cell, to the cathodic region where they will react with oxygen. \u000aCathodic region: O2 + 2H2O + 4e- --> 4OH- \u000aThe electrochemical nature of the rusting of iron explains the importance of moisture in the corrosion process, as it acts as a kind of salt bridge between the anodic and cathodic regions. Steel does not rust in dry air. Salt will also increase the severity of rusting because the dissolvees salt on the moist steel surface increases the conductivity of the aqueous solution formed there and thus accelerates the electrochemical corrosion process. Also, chloride ions form very stable complex ions with Fe3+, and this factor tends to encourage the dissolving of the iron, accelerating the corrosion.

sVCell potential and Free Energy
p34029
VThe change in free energy will equal the maximum useful work obtainable from that process. So, \u2206G = -nFE, and under standard conditions, \u2206G = -nFE°\u000aThis equation states that the maximum cell potential is directly related to the free energy difference between the reactants and the products in the cell. It provides an experimental means to obtain \u2206G for a reaction. It also confirms that a galvanic cell will run in the direction that gives a positive value for Ecell, since a positive Ecell corresponds to a negative \u2206G, which is the condition for spontaneity.

p37379
VThe principle quantum number, n, indicates the shell (or principal energy level) of the atom in which an electron resides and is rough measure of the distance from the nucleus. n can have any value from 1 to infinity. The azimuthal quantum number, l, specifies the sublevel (or orbital) that an electron is located in. This number may be any number from zero up to n-1. This number specifies the shape of an atomic orbital. The magnetic quantum number, m1, indicates the orientation of a sublevel in space. The value of the m1 quantum number can be any number from -l to zero to +l. The spin quantum number, m3, indicates the spin of the electron. An electron is not actually spinning but it is a useful way of visualizing this property. Acceptable values for spin are +1/2 and -1/2. Each electron possesses four quantum numbers. Each electron in an atom must have a set of four quantum numbers different from all other electrons in that atom.

sVMagnitude of \u2206Ssurr
p38431
VDepends on the temperature. The transfer of a given quantity of energy as heat produces a much greater percent change in the randomness of the surroundings at a low temperature than it does at a high temperature. \u2206Ssurr, thus, depends directly on the heat transferred, and inversely on temperature. If the temperature of the surroundings is already high, then so is their average kinetic energy, so added energy will not have as much effect as it would if the temperature (average kinetic energy) were lower. So, \u2206Ssurr will have a greater increase at a lower temperature than at a high temperature.

p40915
VNuclear charge is the number of positive charges in the nucleus. This is the same as the number of protons in the nucleus (Z) and is also the atomic number. The concept of effective nuclear charge is that inner (core) electrons shield outer electrons from the nuclear charge. The outer electrons are attracted by a nuclear charge that is approximately equal to the number of valence electrons. The atomic radius decreases from left to right across the periodic table because the effective nuclear charge increases as the number of valence electrons increases. The increase in effective nuclear charge increases the attractive force on the valence electrons, resulting in a smaller atom.

p43489
VKnowing the \u2206G° values for several reactions allows us to compare the relative tendency of these reactions to occur. The more negative the value of \u2206G°, the further a reaction will go to the right to reach equilibrium. We have to use standard free energy values because free energy varies with concentration/pressure.

Circle the rate law below that is consistent with the mechanism proposed above.

p43567
VThe correct rate law is (rate=[NO\u2082][F\u2082]). \u000a\u000aThis is because the slow reaction of step 1 is the rate determining step, or rate law for the overall reaction. Since the reactants in step one has one NO\u2082 and one F\u2082 the rate law is [NO\u2082][F\u2082]. The coefficients of the slow step is the exponents in the rate law.

p47639
V\u03b1(alpha) particles were fired at gold\u000afoil, and the resulting deflection of the particles were observed. Most of the \u03b1 particles went through the sample undeflected, suggesting that much of the atom was empty space. But of the few \u03b1 particles that were deflected, they were deflected at all angles,\u000aincluding some very wide angles! The wide\u000adeflections suggested a very hard (dense) positively charged core in the atom. However,\u000athis core, or nucleus, must be small in relation\u000ato the overall size of the atom, since so few\u000aof the \u03b1 particles were deflected in the first\u000aplace.

p50475
VBoth temperature and the presence of an enzyme increase the rate of a reaction. Because molecules are moving faster at higher temperatures there are more collisions and therefore more reactions. As a catalyst an enzyme speeds up reactions by facilitating the coming together of the reactants (thus lowering activation energy). At 45 degrees Celsius, the influence of the enzyme is eliminated because the high temperature denatures it and the reaction rate falls back to the rate that occurs in the absence of an enzyme.

sVWhat is the important of \u2206G?
p50813
VThe system can achieve the lowers possible free energy by going to equilibrium, not by going to completion. Therefore, although the value of \u2206G for a given reaction system tells us whether the products or reactants are favored under a given set of conditions, it does not mean that the system will proceed to pure products (if \u2206G is negative) or remain at pure reactants (if \u2206G is positive). Instead, the system will spontaneously go to the equilibrium position; the lowest possible free energy available to it.

The calorimeter heat capacity is 1.23 J/K. Given that the final temperature at thermal equilibrium is 26.2 °C, determine the specific heat capacity of the metal.
p52385
V1) We know this:\u000a\u000aqlost, metal = qgained\u000a2) However, energy is gained by two different entities (the water and the calorimeter itself). Therefore:\u000a\u000aqlost, metal = qgained, water + qgained, calorimeter\u000a3) Substituting, we have:\u000a\u000a(mass) (\u0394t) (Cp, metal) = (mass) (\u0394t) (Cp, water) + (\u0394t of water) (calorimeter constant)\u000a4) Putting values into place and solving:\u000a\u000a(25.6 g) (73.8 °C) (x) = (100.0 g) (1.2 °C) (4.184 J/g °C) + (1.2 °C) (1.23 J/K)\u000ax = 0.266 J/g °C\u000a\u000aComment #1: the °C and the K cancel in this case because (1) one °C is the same size as one K and (2) the 1.2 °C is a temperature difference, not a temperature of 1.2 °C.

VThe maximum possible useful work obtainable from a process at constant temperature and pressure is equal to the change in free energy. \u000awmax = \u2206G\u000a\u2206G for a spontaneous process represents the energy that is free to do useful work. If a process is not spontaneous, \u2206G tells us the minimum amount of work that much be expended to make the process occur. \u000aThe amount of work we actually obtain from a spontaneous process is always less than the maximum possible amount. Achieving the maximum work from a spontaneous process can occur only via hypothetical pathway. Any real pathway wastes energy.

sVPositional Entropy and the Formation of Solutions
p54575
VSolution formation is favored by the natural tendency for substances to mix. The entropy change associated with the mixing of two pure substances is expected to be positive. An increase in entropy is expected because there are many more microstates for the mixed condition than fro the separated condition. This is mostly because of the increase in volume available to a given "particle" after mixing, which thus leads to more available positions. The increase in positional entropy associated with mixing favors the formation of solutions.

p55145
VKinetic energy is a form of energy that results from an object's motion. There are many types of motion that use kinetic energy: translation (moving from one place to another), rotation, and vibration. The measurement of kinetic energy in an object is calculated based on the object's mass and velocity. It is measured in Joules.\u000a\u000aPotential energy is a form of energy that results from an object's position or arrangement of parts. It is stored energy that can become kinetic energy. It includes potential electrical, chemical, and nuclear energy. The measurement of potential energy in an object is calculated based on the object's mass and its height or distance.

VElectrodes that are sensitive to the concentration of a particular ion. Cell potential is sensitive to the concentration of the reactants and products involved in the cell reaction. So, the measured potentials can be used to determine the concentration of an ion. The glass electrode of a pH meter (which actually contains a standard electrode of known potential, the glass electrode, and a potentiometer to measure the difference between the two), which measures concentration using an observed potential, changed potential depending on [H+] ions in the solution. Usually, the glass electrode contains a reference solution of dilute HCl with a thin glass membrane. The electrical potential of the glass electrode depends on the difference in [H+] between the reference solution and the solution into which the electrode is dipped.

sVHow does one determine the maximum potential?
p56757
VIt is necessary to make the measurement under conditions of zero current so that no energy is wasted in the frictional heating of the wire (this occurs with a voltmeter). One can do this with a potentiometer, which is a device in opposition to the cell potential. The voltage of this device is adjusted until no current flows in the cell circuit. Thus, the cell potential is equal in a magnitude and opposite in sign to the voltage setting of the potentiometer. This value is the maximum cell potential, since no energy is wasted heating the wire.

p58787
VThe structure of water is the key to its special propeties. Water is made up one atom of oxygen and two atoms of hydrogen, bonded to a form a molecule\u000a- - Ice: The openings in the lattice make ice less dense than liquid water, so it floats. That causes water to freeze from the top down, so there's always liquid in which organisms can live. Ice floats because of the weakness of hydrogen bonds. This weakness allows hydrogen bonds to constantly break and reform, allowing molecules to periodically approach one another in the liquid state. In the solid state the hydrogen bonds become rigid and form of a crystal that keeps the molecules separated and less dense. This keeps larger bodies of water from freezing solid, allowing life to exist in ponds, lakes, and even oceans\u000a- Cohesion is allowed to happen because of hydrogen bonding, and it contributes to a high surface tension, creating a water surface that is firm enough to allow many insects to walk upon it without sinking, also enables plants to transport water from the roots to the leaves against the force of gravity. It is the linking of like molecules\u000a- Adhesion: Water is transported in plants through both cohesive and adhesive forces; these forces pull water and the dissolved minerals from the roots to the leaves and other parts of the plant.\u000a- Capillary Action: Adhesion is observed when water "climbs" up the tube placed in a glass of water: notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the tube than in the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the charged glass walls of the capillary more than they are to each other and therefore adhere to it. This type of adhesion is called capillary action. It also allows water to move through plant roots and stems and the smallest blood vessels in your body - as one molecule moves up the tree root or through the capillary, it 'pulls' the others with it.\u000a- Heat capacity: moderation of temperature is possible because of water's high specific heat. The amount of heat required to raise or lower the temperature of a substance by 1 degrees celsius. Water has a high specific heat because the hdyrogen bonds between the water molecules must be ddisrupted to raise the temperature. water must lose a large amount of heat and form many additional hydrogen bonds for its temperature to decreatse. This allows our bodies to maintain homeostasis, and Eath's oceans to be relatively stable. \u000a- Universal Solvent: Water is considered the universal solvent because it can dissolve a lot of things. Ionic substances are soluble in water because the poles of the polar water molecules interact with the ionic substances and separate them into ions. Substances with polar covalent bonds are similarly soluble because of the interaction of their poles with those of water\u000a- surface tension: Because of the hydrogen bonding, water molecules are strongly attracted to one another, which gives water a high surface tension. The molecules at the surface of the water "stick together" to form a type of 'skin' on the water, strong enough to support very light objects. Insects that walk on water are taking advantage of this surface tension. Surface tension causes water to clump in drops rather than spreading out in a thin layer.

V1. monatomic ions have an oxidation number that is the same as their charge (ex. S^-2 = -2)\u000a2. for an atom in its elemental form (H2, O2, P4, etc.), the oxidation number is always zero\u000a3. nonmetals usually have negative oxidation numbers, although they can sometimes be positive \u000aa) the oxidation number of oxygen is usually -2 in both ionic and molecular compounds. the major exception is in compounds called peroxides, which contain the O2^-2 ion, giving each oxygen an oxidation number of -1.\u000ab) oxidation # of hydrogen is usually +1 when bonded to nonmetals and -1 when bonded to metals (NaOH = H is -1)\u000ac) oxidation # of fluorine is -1 in all compounds. the other halogens have an oxidation number of -1 in most binary compounds, when combined with oxygen, as is oxyanions, however, they have positive oxidation states\u000a4. the sum of the oxidation numbers of all atoms is zero. the sum of the oxidation numbers in a polyatomic ion equals the charge of the ion
