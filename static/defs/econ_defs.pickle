sVA. Assume that a product has an elastic demand. Explain what will occur to the firm's total revenue if the price of the product is increased.\u000a\u000aB. List and explain three (3) factors that could impact price elasticity of demand for a product.\u000a\u000aC. What is income elasticity? How is it used by economists?\u000a\u000aD. What is cross elasticity of demand? How is it used by economists?
p25
VA. Elasticity of demand is a percentage measurement that shows how a change in price will bring about a larger change in quantity demanded. If something has a high elasticity, the firm will have to lower the price in order to earn more. Therefore, if the price of the product is increased, their total revenue will decrease as a result. \u000a \u000aB. Three factors that can impact the price elasticity of demand are ability to substitute. This basically means that if the product or service can be easily substituted for another, possibly cheaper, good then the price elasticity will become lower. For example, if a product has a large amount of substitutes, it will be extremely elastic. Another factor that can impact elasticity is whether or not the product is a necessity. When a product is a necessity, it is something that people need or feel obliged to buy no matter what the price. An example of a necessity is a prescription drug or gasoline. People with high blood pressure need to take their medication daily, otherwise it could be detrimental to their health. In order to transport themself and others from place to place - people need to buy gasoline for their cars. Although they will probably complain, people will usually buy the gasoline regardless of the price. The final factor that can impact the price elasticity of demand for a product is the time in which a price stays extremely high on a particular product. The longer that the price is high, the higher the elasticity of that particular product will be. An example of this is if you go to the grocery store to buy a specific product like toilet paper. If the price of the toilet paper has increased, you will buy it that particular time but might choose to buy it elsewhere the next time. \u000a \u000aC. Income elasticity is the percentage change in quantity demanded of a good in response to a one percent change in consumer income. It is a measure of responsiveness of demand to a change in income. Income elasticity is used by economists in order to measure changes in demand. For example, if consumer income increases and the demand for a good increases, the good is a normal good. However, if an increase in income leads to a decrease in consumption of some good or service, that particular product is an inferior good. \u000a \u000aD. Cross elasticity of demand is the percentage change in the quantity demanded for good A in response to a change in the price of good B, where A and B are either substitutes or complements of each other. The concept of cross price elasticity of demand helps economists to better understand markets. The formula that they use to calculate the cross elasticity is: percent of change in demand of product A / percent of change in price of product.

V1. Add up the total value of firms production of final goods and services (excludes the value of intermediate goods and services because we don't want to count the value of each producer's sales because we would count the same items several times and artificially inflate the calculation of GDP ... additionally to avoid double counting we only count each producer's value added in the calculation of GDP - the difference between the value of its sales and the value of the inputs it purchases from other businesses.. at each stage of production we subtract the cost of inputs/ intermediate goods)\u000a\u000a2. Add up AGGREGATE SPENDING on domestically produced final goods and services in the economy( sum of consumer spending, investment spending, government purchases, and XIM)\u000a- can be measured by the flow of funds into firms\u000a- avoid double counting by only counting the value of sales to final buyers (exclude sales of inputs from one business to another)\u000a- GDP = C + I + G + X - IM\u000a\u000a3. Sum the total factor income earned by households from firms in the economy\u000a- add up all income earned by the factors of production in the economy (wages earned by labor, interest earned by those who lend their savings to firms and gov't, rend earned by those who lease their land to structures or firms & the profit earned by the share holders, the owners of the firm's physical capital.\u000a- good way to measure GDP bc the money firms earn by selling goods and services must go somewhere; whatever is not paid as wages, interest, or rent is profit and part of profit is paid out to shareholders as dividends.

p1110
sVThe demand curve slopes downward and to the right. List and explain three (3) reasons of effects that help explain this downward slope.
p1111
VIf the demand curve slopes downward and to the right there can be three reasons as to why. These reasons include an increasing marginal utility, the effect of income, and the substitution effect. As more of a specific good or service is consumer, a consumer gets less and less satisfaction towards that good with each additional unit. Therefore, like in the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, a downward slope will be reflected onto the demand curve. Income can be an effect because as income increases, more commodities will be purchased and consumer by the consumers and vice versa. If income decreases, less will be purchased and the demand curve will slope downward and to the right. Finally, the substitution effect can have an effect because if there are a large amount of substitutions, the consumer can choose the other products for various reasons and the demand curve will change as a result.

VWith a small number of workers, output is low and a division of labor cannot be employed, and workers cannot specialize or develop new skills. However, marginal returns increase quickly as specialization occurs and efficiency increases.

sVBuying vs. Selling Government Bonds
p1581
VBasically, the government is purchasing long-term bonds in order to push down long-term interest rates. The reduction in long-term interest rates, in turn, is meant to stimulate investment and other forms of spending. The main way that the Fed influences interest rates is by buying and selling government bonds. It decides whether to increase or decrease interest rates depending on whether it aims to pump up or rein in overall demand for goods and services. When Fed policymakers decide that they want to raise interest rates, the Fed sells government bonds. This sale reduces the price of bonds and raises the interest rate on these bonds. When Fed policymakers decide they want to lower interest rates, the Fed buys government bonds. This purchase increases the price of bonds and lowers the interest rate on these bonds.

sVMechanisms of Speciation
p2173
VIn a natural environment, there are four modes of speciation: Allopatric, Peripatric, Parapatric and Sympatric Speciation. \u000a\u000aAllopatric (allo=other, patric=place) Speciation. This refers to speciation by geographic isolation. During this mode, a group of organisms are split into two or more due to extrinsic changes such as mountain building or habitat fragmentation, which prevent regular mating between subgroups.\u000aPeripatric (peri=near, patric=place) Speciation. This is a special version of allopatric speciation where one of the subgroup have very few individuals. In this small subgroup, rare genes that happen to be carried by the subgroup members are more likely to be passed down and populated, resulting in a change of the gene frequency in the future generations. Accumulation of such changes eventually make it a different species from its ancestor (i.e. cannot mate and make reprodu). This is sometimes known as the founder effect.\u000aParapatric (para=beside, patric=place) Speciation. In parapatric speciation there is no specific extrinsic barrier to gene flow, but the mating behavior itself is NOT random. Individuals are more likely to mate with their geographic neighbors. This also results in a reduced gene flow within the population. Varied gene frequencies leads to varied selection pressure and gradually new species form even if there is no geographic barriers.\u000aSympatric (sym=same, patric=place) Speciation. This I think is the most drastic type of speciation. It does not require large-scale geographic change or distance. It happens to members in the same group living in the same place. This can happen when some individuals try out a new niche, e.g. some fruit flies decided to start eating apples instead of bananas as many of their peers did. It can also happen when some internal changes occur that significantly alter some individuals, e.g. polyploidization (increase of chromosome numbers) in some individuals will inhibit them from mating with peers of different chromosome numbers. This happens mostly in plants.

Va. How will the bad publicity impact the demand for Jessica's product? Graphically illustrate the change with a correctly labeled supply and demand graph. \u000a\u000a(I can e-mail you a supply & demand graph for this if necessary - so just let me know. For now I'll just explain how it would look!) Bad publicity will definitely negatively impact the demand for Jessica's product. Since there are many substitutes in the fast food industry - the demand will be greatly affected by many factors including negative publicity. Graphically, this would show a leftward shift on the demand curve - in order to describe that negative impact and decreased demand. \u000a \u000ab. Explain how the results you showed in Part A, above, will impact the number of worker-hours and the wage rate Jessica pays to her Buffalo Wings workers. \u000a\u000aThe decreased demand will require the company to cut worker-hours and wage rates accordingly. The number of worker-hours will decrease because the demand for the products is decreasing at a rate where, if everything in the company were to stay the same, keeping the same amount of workers and an identical wage would be impractical and potentially detrimental. The wages for these workers would probably also need to decrease in order to keep company revenue up at a steady level. \u000a \u000ac. A new study is released that not only pronounces Jessica's chicken clean and safe to eat, it also produces convincing evidence that consumption of large amounts of chicken wings with BBQ sauce increases intelligence in teenage consumers substantially. How will this new study impact the wage rate and employment at Jessica's restaurant? Illustrate this change with an appropriate graph. \u000a\u000aThis new study will positively impact the demand for Jessica's Buffalo Wings and will produce a significant shift towards the right on the demand curve. The increased demand will require Jessica to hire more employees and potentially raise her wage rate in order to entire these potential workers. We don't know the extent of the impact that this study will have but it is safe to assume that it will at least return her to her original state in the market. If this is the case, the demand curve will be more rightward than the original.

Thus, people will buy more U.S.-produced\u000agoods and fewer foreign produced goods. This increases net exports, a component of real GDP.

p4421
VTotal revenue (TR), is the total flow of income to a firm from selling a given quantity of output at a given price, less tax going to the government. The value of TR is found by multiplying price of the product by the quantity sold.\u000aAverage revenue (AR), is revenue per unit, and is found by dividing TR by the quantity sold, Q. AR is equivalent to the price of the product, where P x Q/Q = P, hence AR is also price.\u000aMarginal revenue (MR) is the revenue generated from selling one extra unit of a good or service. It can be found by finding the change in TR following an increase in output of one unit. MR can be both positive and negative.

p5333
VThe seemingly self-contradictory but possibly true statement that increased saving may be both good and bad for the economy. It is always good in the long run when matched with increased investment spending, but may be bad in the short run if there is a recession because it reduces spending on goods and services. If the increased savings are not translated into increased investment, then the fall in consumption spending will not be made up for by an increase in investment. The overall result will be a decrease in output and employment. If the decline in GDP is severe enough, the attempt to save more will actually lead to less overall savings because the higher rate of saving will be applied to a smaller national income. Attempts by households to save more during a recession may simply worsen the recession and result in less saving

sVA. Define supply as an economist would.\u000aB. List and explain three (3) non-price factors that will shift the supply curve.\u000aC. If the cost of production of fountain pens falls, how will the market for fountain pens be impacted? (hint: start by drawing the appropriate supply and demand curves)
p5905
VA. Supply refers to the relationship between the quantity of a good or services that consumers will offer for sale and the price that is actually charged for that particular good. \u000a \u000aB. There are many determinants of a shift in the supply curve. One of those is an increase or change in technology. These technological advances result in improvements in the quality of production and time it takes to produce. This will therefore result in shifts in supply. Taxes and Subsidies also can make a difference in the supply curve. An increase in taxes can decrease supply as they are a cost to the producers. A subside, on the other hand, will increase the supply and therefore - shift the supply curve down. A final factor that can shift a supply curve is the number of sellers there are. If there is an increase in the number of suppliers - there will be an increase in supply and a downward shift in the supply curve. If there is a decrease in the number of suppliers - there will be a decrease in supply and an upward shift in the supply curve. \u000a \u000aC. If the cost of production of fountain pens fall, the producers will receive more profits or the price of the fountain pens will go down. People will probably buy more fountain pens - making the demand go up significantly. A decrease in the cost for the producer's will create an increase in supply. Since fountain pens aren't a necessity but are important, there won't be an enormous increase in demand but there will be somewhat of an increase.

sVSuppose the University of Oklahoma decides to alter its tuition schedule by separating its students based on how many credit hours they have accumulated. Students with fewer than 15 credit hours get a 13% reduction in tuition while students with 45-90 and more than 90 credit hours face an increase in tuition of 22 and 71%, respectively. Fully explain whether this pricing strategy is rooted in a sound understanding of the price elasticity of demand, or not.
p8193
VIf the University of Oklahoma alters their tuition based on the credit hours of students in the way listed above, it is due to a lack of sound understanding of the price elasticity of demand. Elasticity of demand is defined as a percentage measurement that shows how a change in price will bring about a larger change in quantity demanded. Personally, I think it would be more efficient to increase tuition for students with fewer than 15 credit hours and decrease it for those with 45+. It would bring about an incentive for people to sign up for more credit hours because they would be saving money and therefore, would bring about an increase in quantity of credit hours demanded. Therefore, the total revenue for the university would be greater as a result.

sVEconomies growth means greater output of goods and services. Higher standards of living are derived from greater output per person (per capita as it is sometimes called). Technological improvements and capital accumulation are two major growth factors. How does the market system promote each factor?
p8899
VThe market system provides a strong incentive for technological advance and enables better prod- ucts and processes to supplant inferior ones. An entrepreneur or firm that introduces a popular new product will gain revenue and economic profit at the expense of rivals.Technological advance also includes new and improved methods that reduce production or dis- tribution costs. By passing on part of its cost reduction to the consumer through a lower product price, the firm can increase sales and obtain economic profit at the expense of rival firms.Most technological advances require additional capital goods. The market system provides the resources necessary to produce those goods through increased dollar votes for capital goods.But who will register votes for capital goods? Answer: entrepreneurs and owners of businesses. As receivers of profit income, they often use part of that income to purchase capital goods.

sVDiminishing marginal utility (something else that it explains)
p8901
V- It explains why size does not correlate exactly with price (e.g. a small popcorn costs $1.00, but a large popcorn twice the size of the small popcorn costs $1.50 instead of $2.00)\u000a- Companies do this so that we are willing to pay the bigger price
p8902
sVWhere do MC and ATC curve cross?
p8903
VMC and ATC must cross at the bottom of the ATC curve (the bottom of the U). When the cost of making the next unit (MC) less than the current average cost, it lowers the average. When MC is higher than the current average, it raises the average. So, the point where ATC stops declining and starts rising is where it equals MC.

p11045
VA. Why is specialization generally beneficial to an economy?\u000a\u000aSpecialization is generally beneficial to the economy because resources are obviously limited and it allows for these resources to be used in the most methodical and systematic way. In the end, it allows for more goods to be produced with the same amount of resources, as limited as they may be. \u000a \u000aB. How will specializing and trading change the economy?\u000a\u000aSpecializing and trading will change the economy because it allows for efficiency in the economy. Specializing calls for more efficient use of capital while trading means more goods are attainable to consumers at low price tags. Because of this, the entire economy will grow and the average way of life will be more efficient and allow for people to be more please. Despite positive change, trade can also be negative. It can mean that resources will be redirected to different nations and therefore, losing jobs and industries to those of other nations that are being traded with.\u000a \u000aC. Why would some people and nations oppose trade and specialization?\u000a\u000aThere are various reasons as to why some people and nations oppose trade and specialization. Free trade, in particular, can be positive to some people and detrimental to others. The reasons as to why someone would oppose trade and specialization include factors such as national security, retaliation, protection of jobs, foreign wages, as well as politics. National security is a big factor because governments often feel that restricting the exporting and importing of specific goods is best for the nation as a result of different factors. As a historical example, 9/11 which was 13 years ago today, has resulted in the implementation of many different changes not only in security in airports but has resulted in trading restrictions as well. It may not seem like it has an impact on the economy, but in the long run - changes were made and fear was induced into people to make them feel uncomfortable with trade and national security. Another reason that nations often oppose national security is because they want the production of goods to stay in their own country in order to improve the economy in the sense of jobs and money produced in the nation.

Convert a figure in 1990 to its current value=> current value = value in 1990 * (CPI in 2000/CPI in 1995). For example, Babe Ruth earned $80,000 in 1931. Translating to current dollars means: current value = 80,000 * (107.6/8.7) = $989,000. So $80,000 back then is equivalent to $989,000 today...THIS ONE IS CRUCIAL!!!!!!

p18411
VEach point on the production possibilities curve represents some maximum output of the 2 products. Points fine inside to the left of the curve are also attainable, but they reflect inefficiency and therefore are not as desirable as points on the curve. Points inside the curve imply that the economy could have more of both of the two products if it achieved full employment and productive efficiency. Points flying outside to the right of the production possibilities curve, like point W, which represent a greater output and the output at any point on the curve. Such points, however, are unattainable with the current supplies of resources and technology.

This tends to understate the unemployment rate.\u000aAlso, discouraged workers who are not actively searching for jobs anymore are not\u000acounted in the labor force.

p18453
Vb. What types of resources are available for the firm to hire? Give examples of each type of resource. \u000a As visible through the circular model we have studied - we know that since Basil's company acts as a firm, the resources that are available to him are that of land, labor, and capital. The term "land" could represent the land that is used to grow the plants he is selling. "Labor" could refer to the employees he hires to perform tasks such as packaging the plants or providing landscaping services. Finally, "capital" can describe the machines that he uses like lawn mowers or leaf blowers. \u000a \u000ad. How are the prices of the resources determined?\u000a\u000aThe prices of these resources are determined through the factor market. These prices are dependent upon different factors such as the degree of discrimination. However, these resources are most likely to be priced at the equilibrium price. \u000a \u000af. Basil can employ several workers to dig the necessary holes and ditches on his clients' land or purchase a single specialized back-hoe and hire only one operator to dig these holes and ditches. Explain how he should make his decision. \u000a\u000aIn order to make this decision, Basil will have to consider both the costs and utilities necessary for both his options. By employing several workers to do various tasks, he would have a low fixed cost but high variable costs - which he would need to consider whether that would be beneficial to have in his business. By purchasing a single specialized back-hoe and hiring a single operator, he would have a high fixed cost up front and a low variable cost. He would need to consider whether he was willing to put that large sum of money out up front in order to potentially save later on. \u000a \u000ah. How is the "product flow" from Basil's company diverted to the "money flow" in the Circular Flow Model.\u000a\u000aThe product flow from Basil's landscaping company is diverted to the money flow in the Circular Flow Model through the revenue and profit he receives for his plants (goods) and landscaping services. He has to pay wages, rent, and interest (product flow) but will be diverted to receiving revenue, as I mentioned before (money flow).

sVEmergency room health care tends to have a demand curve that is very steeply sloped, while elective surgery does not. Why? Also, health care insurance and vacation spending tend to have a negative cross price elasticity of demand for many people. Why?
p18625
VEmergency room health care tends to have a demand curve that is very steeply sloped while elective surgery does not because emergency room health care isn't as debate-able. If you are in an emergency situation, the first priority is to recover from that emergency and get the surgery. Therefore, the bill comes last and you don't really have the chance to look around for better prices like you would have in an elective surgery. That being said, in an elective surgery you have more time to figure out where you want to get it or if you do at all. Therefore, hospitals and doctors, although unmoral, can charge more in the emergency room. Health insurance and vacation spending tend to have a negative cross price elasticity of demand for many people. This is because if spending on healthcare increases - many people have to take that extra money out of another budget, oftentimes the vacation budget. They will use the money that they had planned out for vacations in order to pay for the more expensive healthcare plan.

sVRelationship of demand of money and interest rate
p21245
VThe relationship between interest rate and the money demand is presented in a curve; Money demand increases means a shift of money demand curve. If we draw money demand in an interest rate-amount of money demand in real terms space, i.e. y-axis is long-term interest rate while x-axis is money demand in real terms, we can see the curve of money demand is downward sloping.\u000aMoney is a medium of transaction. Thus, money demand is related to the demand of transaction. The more demand of transaction carried out, the more money demand.\u000aWhen money demand increase, for all interest rate level, the quantity of money demand will increase. Thus, the whole money demand curve shifts rightwards. \u000aIt will achieve another equilibrium in money market, where the interest rate level is higher than initial equilibrium interest rate. You can refer to the graph above.

p22895
VA. A market economy is an economy in which decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on supply and demand, and prices of goods and services are determined in a free price system. One of the functions of price in a market economy is performing a signalling function and adjusting to demonstrate where resources are and are not needed. Another function is their preferences. Depending upon what consumers need, prefer, and want - producers will respond accordingly and either raise or decrease output as a result. \u000a \u000aB. Prices are determined in a free market economy through the similarities and interactions between supply and demand. Demand, for a refresh, is the quantity of a particular product that consumers are willing to purchase according to that a certain price. Supply, on the other hand, is the amount of a particular product that sellers can vendor to customers at a certain price. Oftentimes, price plays a pertinent role in how sellers determine their prices and the way in which consumers act upon those prices. \u000a \u000aC. When the government interferes with a price level - it is referred to as either a price floor or a price ceiling. A price floor is the lowest legal price a commodity can be sold at as set by the government in order to prevent prices from being too low. A price ceiling, on the other hand, occurs when the government puts a legal limit on how high the price of a product can be. In order for it to be effective and efficient, it must be set below the market equilibrium. Therefore, if the government interferes with the price level that the free market has determined, demand could decrease dramatically if they set the price ceiling too high. If they set the price floor too low, producers could run out of supply at a rapid rate and even go into bankruptcy. (Again, unsure of how to include graphs...)

p23023
V1. There are three basic questions that each economy must answer. List and explain each question. \u000a\u000aThe three basic questions that each economy must answer are as follows: What to produce, whom to produce for, and how to produce it. What to produce means what types of products will be produced in that economy. Whom to produce for stands to represent whom they will be making and directing these specific products to. Finally, how to produce it refers to how the products will be made. \u000a \u000a2. There are three basic economic systems. List them (do not include mixed economy).\u000a\u000aThe three types of basic economy systems are market, command, and traditional. \u000a \u000a3. How does each economic system answer the three basic questions?\u000a\u000aA market economy relies on a system of intertwined markets in order to allocate the goods and services. The unique markets are in charge of determining and coordinating their own plans and services and answering all of the questions. In a market economy, the 'who' are the business who base it on supply and demand and free enterprise. The 'how' is determined by the businesses themselves. When asking whom they are produced for, a market economy's response would be that they are produced for a wide variety of consumers. In a command economy, however, the questions are answered by the government or larger power system. It is all done through central planning and control by one specific source rather than dividing it among all of the producers and relying on them. In a command economy, the government makes all the decisions on what to produce. The government is also in control of how to produce the goods and whom they are produced for. Since a traditional economy is non-industrialized, different agricultural and other non-industrial goods are produced, they are produced by different small organizations and local families. They are produced for these families and tribes or they are traded for other goods or services. \u000a \u000a4. Which economic system uses its resources most efficiently to meet the needs of its citizens?\u000a\u000aI would say that the economic system that effectively uses its resources in order to meet the needs of citizens is a market economy. This is my belief because a market economy has little restrictions and control over businesses and therefore, allows for more flexibility in meeting the needs of each and every citizen and businesses.

sVTaxation in America is always a "hot topic." In designing a taxation system\u000a\u000aa. what are the basic principles to be considered?\u000ab. how is the burden of a tax calculated?\u000ac. list the three basic tax burdens (Hint: one of them is "progressive.") and list examples of each.\u000ad. if the government creates a tax on wealth that taxes the first $50,000 of assets a person owns at 1%, the next $50,000 at 2%, the third at 3% and so on, what type of tax burden is that? How much tax would you owe if you had $125,000 in assets (car, personal property and small home)?
p23287
Va. The basic principles that are to be considered when designing a taxation system are adequacy, broad basing, compatibility, convenience, earmarking, efficiency, equity, neutrality, predictability, tax exemptions, and simplicity. To make more sense of those words, I'll go into more depth with them below. \u000a- adequacy: in this case, taxes should be only enough to generate revenue that is necessary for provision of essential public services. \u000a- broad basing: this refers to the fact that taxes should be spread out over a large section of the population in order to minimize the individual tax burdens, if at all possible. \u000a- compatibility: the coordination of taxes which leads to and ensures tax neutrality. \u000a- convenience: this mentions the fact that taxes need to be enforced in a way where voluntary compliance is facilitated to the maximum possible extent. \u000a- earmarking: refers to funds that are set aside in order to pay for a particular project or event\u000a- efficiency: this is an attempt to minimize tax liability when given many different financial decisions. \u000a- equity: refers to the fact that taxes should equally burden all people in similar economic situations.\u000a- neutrality: where taxes shouldn't favor any one group or class over another and shouldn't be designed to interfere with a certain individuals decision making. \u000a- predictability: the idea that the collection of taxes should reinforce their inevitability and regularity. \u000a- restricted exemptions: refers to the concept that tax exemptions must only be used for specific purposes and a limited period of time. \u000a- simplicity: the concept that tax assessment and determination should be easily understandable by the common member of the population and average taxpayer. \u000a \u000ab. Tax burden is not calculated based on where the revenue is collected but rather on the price elasticity of demand as well as the price elasticity of supply. \u000a \u000ac. The three basic tax burdens are progressive, regressive, and proportional. A progressive tax rate means the more money that you make, the more money you pay in taxes. For example, a 10% proportional tax would mean that making 100 dollars pays 10% or 10 dollars in taxes while someone making 500,000 dollars would pay 50,000 in taxes. In a regressive tax rate, the more money you make, the lower your tax burden. As an example, with Social Security, there is a distinct limit on how much of your income you pay towards this tax. Let's just say that the limit is $50,000 and the law says you must pay 6% in Social Security taxes up to $50,000 of income, but any income over $50k would not be taxed. If Jamie were to make $40,000 and Nathan were to make $60,000 then Jamie would pay 6% of her income and Nathan would pay 6% on the first $50k earned but not on the last $10,000. So as you can see, the more you make, the less you pay. Finally, in proportional tax rates, everyone pays the same tax rate, regardless of their income. It is often referred to as a flat tax. For example, if Maggie were to make $15,000 and Nick were to make $90,000 and the tax rate is a proportional 10% - both Maggie and Nick would pay 10% of their respective incomes. \u000a \u000ad. This tax burden would be that of a progressive tax rate because the more money that is made, the more money is payed in taxes. If someone were to have $125,000 in assets, they would owe $2,500 because it falls within the second $50,000 and would, therefore, only have a 2% tax rate.

VA. I don't understand a way that I can plot/draw a supply and demand curve on the quiz or a way to attach it. If I'm missing something let me know. Otherwise, let me know if you would like me to e-mail you this portion of the question! \u000a \u000aB. The result of the government putting a price floor on the product will be a shift in supply and a shift in demand. As the price goes up, if the product isn't a necessity, the demand will go down. People will be wanting less and less of the product if it is at $8 rather than the previous $2 starting price. The supply will go up because of the decrease in demand and increase in revenue. The end result would be a loss of profit and sales for the company selling the product. \u000a \u000aC. The price ceiling, or maximum price that a seller can sell a specific product for, there will be a definite result on the product's supply and demand. If the maximum amount that the seller can sell the product for is $4, the seller will automatically see an increase in demand. People will always want to buy products if they are at a lower price point. Because of this sudden demand surge - the supply of the products will probably go down as a result. \u000a \u000aD. If Schedule #2 makes a sudden shift to Schedule #3, the equilibrium values for Pe and Qe will change. Pe should go up according to the price. Qe should go down, according to the quantity. Something that could have caused such a change is an increase in price as a result of demand increasing. The product may have increased in popularity because a celebrity was seen using it or ad campaigns were going out. There are various other plausible reasons as to why price would increase and quantity would decrease.

p27175
VWhen one side of a transaction has information that the other does not, the situation is in favor of the party with more information, resulting in negative consequences for the party with less info, often losing money. This can be called the "knowledge bonus". For instance, if an auto insurance company offers one rate, which is higher than normal but remains constant, and offers another lower one which increases per accident, good drivers will choose the policy which is lower, but increases per accident, while poor drivers will choose the one which is slightly higher, but remains constant. Thus, the company 'loses' the extra revenue it would have gained from lousy drivers getting into accidents, and the revenue it would have gained from good drivers paying a higher rate. Thus, because the company does not know who the good and bad drivers are, it suffers.

It is difficult for countries to specialize in producing one product, since the market for a product can always decline. Also, changing weather patterns can destroy specialized agriculture products, adding further instability to incomes and exports in developing countries. \u000a\u25cb Expanding trade between two countries may hurt some industries and individuals within each country. Industries finding themselves at a comparative disadvantages may be forces to scale back production and lay off workers. The government may need to provide workers with help to ensure a smooth transition to new production.

sVA. Define utility as an economist would.\u000a\u000aB. State and explain the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility.\u000a\u000aC. How is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility reflected in the demand curve?
p28535
VA. Utility is a term that is used to describe the measurement of how useful a good is to a consumer. It refers to the satisfaction that is received by consumers after using that particular good or service. \u000a \u000aB. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is an economic law that states that as a person consumes more of a product, there is a decline in the marginal utility in which that person receives from consumer each additional unit of that particular product. For example, even the most appealing and delicious foods like pizza will appeal less and less to a customer as they eat more and more of it. If you had to eat pizza everyday for a month, you probably wouldn't want to continue eating it everyday following. Consumers often make use of this by consuming a wide variety of goods rather than a large amount of one. \u000a \u000aC. The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility is reflected in the demand curve as a negative slope. The particular law means that the value of a certain good and utility derived from it declines as more of the good is consumed. It eventually helps to explain the negative or downward slope of the demand curve.

Later in his life he wrote "Das Kapital," which discussed the labor theory of value. Marx's work laid the foundations for future communist leaders, such as Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin, and for a political system that would take hold in countries including Russia, China, North Korea and Eastern Europe. Marx is often criticized for discussing economic theory and the exploitation of the working class while failing to maintain a job for a significant period of time.

This helps us use the world's resources in the best and most efficient way.\u000aDependence is mutual. It doesn't benefit either side to negatively affect the other's economy because a) it will affect trade (from which both countries make money) and b) the other country will retaliate and use their economic power to affect you negatively.

p30551
VEconomic goods and services are limited, while the need to use services of these goods and services seem limitless. There are simply not enough goods and services to satisfy even a small fraction of everyone's consumption desires. Thus, societies must decide how to use these limited resources and distribute them among different people. This means, to get one thing that we like, we usually have to give up another thing that we also like. Making decision requires trading off one goal against another.

p32097
VSpending to increase productivity or output in an economy. Investment spending includes the market value of the products that are built but not sold, what economists call changes in business inventories. When these products are sold, the difference between the inventory value and the selling price is added to or subtracted from GDP. If total output exceeds current sales, inventories that are a form of investment spending, build up. If businesses produce more goods than they sell, the unsold inventories will increase GDP. Increases in inventories usually precede decreases in production as businesses cut back until inventories are sold. If businesses are able to sell more than they produce in a time period, inventories are drawn down and thus GDP decreases.

sVKeynesian/ neo classical
p32691
VKeynesian models assume frictions in markets. Prices don't adjust quickly to shifts in demand or supply, so any shock the market will show up in relatively large shifts in quantities. Prices are relatively inflexible, quantities are relatively flexible.\u000a\u000aNeoclassic models assume much the opposite. Markets have few frictions, and prices adjust quickly and simply, meaning quantities don't change when there's a shock to supply or demand. Prices are flexible, quantities aren't.\u000a\u000aIn these simple terms, shifts in quantities are a "real" change and shifts in prices are nominal (they don't change these things we care about). A shock in Keynesian model will have some effect on the economy other than changing prices. In a Neoclassical model, not so much.\u000a\u000aBecause of this, you get rather different behavior in the two styles of models. Neoclassical models tend to work better for long-run phenomena (when prices have time to adjust), and Keynesian models tend to work better for short-run phenomena (when they don't). Neoclassical models work better when we're near full employment and the economy is good. Keynesian models work better when this isn't the case. The models are much broader than the standard answer of "Keynesian says markets don't clear so we need fiscal policy, Neoclassical says they do and we don't" that shows up often in conversations.

VA market economy is defined as an economy where the decisions on what to produce, how to produce, and whom will get what is produced are decidedly solely by free individuals and business firms. In a pure market economy, consumers are the ones who decide the answers to these three basic economic questions. When pondering 'what to produce' they will often decided solely based on their own needs as consumers. They will also base this upon the competition and scarcity. 'How to produce' is determined by the resources that are available which depends upon what exactly is being produced. Finally, it is decided 'for whom to produce' is answered through supply and demand as the goods are produced for those who are willing and able to purchase them.

p35325
VThe Federal Reserve and other central banks try to stabilize their economies, limiting fluctuations of actual output to around potential output, while also keeping inflation low but positive. Under the Taylor rule for monetary policy, the target interest rate rises when there is inflation, or a positive output gap or both. Some central banks engage in inflation targeting, which is a forward looking policy rule, whereas the Taylor rule is a backward looking policy rule. In practice, the Fed appears to operate on a loosely defined version of the Taylor rule. Because monetary policy is subject to fewer implementation lags than fiscal policy, it is the preferred policy tool for stabilizing the economy.

sVThe state of California recently considered passing a tax on the services of doctors in that state in order to raise revenue to pay for universal health coverage for California residents. Suppose the average open heart surgery costs $100,000, and at that price 23,339 surgeries are performed each year. Fully explain what the most likely outcome would be in this market if a tax on surgeries is implemented. Use a graph if it will help.
p36741
VIf a tax is implemented on these surgeries, a predictable outcome would be negative. Because taxes eventually will result in the reduction of supply, these surgeries would cost more and fewer surgeries would end up taking place - resulting in a loss of money. Since it is such a substantial sum of money, taxing it could be considered both immoral and inconsiderate. As a result of these factors, health insurance premiums would rise, making the entire ordeal result in a worse outcome than where it began.

sVA. Define "demand" as an economist would.\u000a\u000aB. List and explain three (3) non-price determinants of demand that can shift the demand curve.\u000a\u000aC. Explain the difference between "a change in demand" and "a change in quantity demanded." Use of a graph is encouraged but not required.
p37601
VA. Demand is the relationship between the quantity of a good or service that consumers will purchase and the price charged for that particular good. \u000a \u000aB. There are countless non-price determinants of demand that have the possibility of shifting the demand curve. Some of these determinants include, but are not limited to, the price of related goods, income, and tastes or preferences. The prices of substitute and complement goods can alter the demand for the original good. An example of this is that if the price of ice cream increases, the demand for sprinkles will decrease. A rise in a person's income can lead to a rightward shift in the demand curve - or increase in demand. A fall in a person's income, however, will result in a leftward shift in the curve. Finally, consumer preferences can make significant impacts on their demands. If it is a favorable change, it will lead to an increase in demand (shift in demand curve to the right). If it is an unfavorable change, however, it will lead to a decrease in demand (shift in demand curve to the left). \u000a \u000aC. There is a significant difference between a change in demand and a change in quantity demanded. A change in quantity demanded results from a change in the price of goods. If the price of a particular good increases, the quantity demanded will decrease. However, a change in demand, occurs when one or more of the determinants of demand changes. As I mentioned in the previous question, determinants of demand can include price of related goods, income, and consumer preferences. Again, I don't know how to include a graph onto this format but would definitely be willing to do so if you would like me to e-mail you one.

p38070
sVAssume that the following conditions exist for a perfectly competitive firm:\u000aprice = $8.50, current output = 100 units, ATC at current output = $9.00, AVC at current output = $8.00, total fixed costs =$100 and MC at current output = $8.00.\u000aa. Is the firm earning any economic profit currently? How much is its profit or loss?\u000a\u000ab. Is the firm maximizing its economic profit? What should the firm do to maximize profit or minimize loss?\u000a\u000ac. Given your answers in part b, how will the market adjust to reach long-run equilibrium? Include appropriate graphs in your explanation.
p38071
Va. Profit = (P-ATC) * Q ; Economic Profit = (8.50-9.00)*100 = -50. As a result of the calculations made, it is clear that the firm is not currently earning any economic profit. They are, on the contrary, losing economic profit, at a rate of 50. \u000a \u000ab. No, the firm is not maximizing their economic profit - as clear by the fact that they are experiencing a loss, rather than a profit. As you know, in a perfectly competitive firm, they choose their own output levels in order to efficiently maximize profits and therefore minimize loss. The main way to do this is by calculating the optimal level of output where Marginal Cost is equal to Market Price. \u000a \u000ac. In the long-run equilibrium of a perfectly competitive firm, the market price, number of competing firms, and their specific scale of production need to be adjusted so that the firm produces at the lowest point on the long-run average cost curve. This is so that it can achieve economic efficiency, profit maximization, perfect competition, and the remaining conditions of the long-run equilibrium. Therefore, in order to reinstate what was previously said, the firm will need to alter their market price in order to reach an eventual long-run equilibrium.\u000a(I can include a graph for this is necessary - just let me know and I'll make them and e-mail them to you as soon as I can.)

sVfactors influencing price of elasticity of supply
p39505
VThe availability of substitutes: If sellers of the good can easily switch between various goods, the elasticity of supply will be high. If the price of one good drops, the suppliers of that good can and will switch to producing the other good (substitute.)\u000aLength of time analyzed: The longer a time period, the more elastic the supply. This is because suppliers can change to producing a good if they are given a long enough period of time in which to do so.\u000aAvailability of raw materials: for example, availability may cap the amount of gold that can be produced in a country regardless of price. \u000aLength and complexity of production: Much depends on the complexity of the production process. Textile production is relatively simple. The labor is largely unskilled and production facilities are little more than buildings - no special structures are needed. Therefore the PES for textiles is elastic. On the other hand, the PES for specific types of motor vehicles is relatively inelastic. Auto manufacture is a multi-stage process that requires specialized equipment, skilled labor, a large suppliers network and large R&D costs. Therefore the more complex and difficult the product the less elastic the PES.\u000aMobility of factors: If the factors of production are easily available and if a producer producing one good can switch their resources and put it towards the creation of a product in demand, then it can be said that the PES is relatively elastic. The inverse would make the PES relatively inelastic.\u000aExcess capacity: A producer who has unused capacity can quickly respond to price changes in the market, assuming that variable factors are readily available.\u000aInventories: A producer who has a supply of goods or available storage capacity can quickly increase supply to market.

p41623
VThe effects of unexpected inflation are:\u000aIt hurts people with fixed nominal incomes, since the money they earn isn't worth as much anymore. It hurts people who save in fixed-value accounts It benefits debtors (borrowers) while hurting creditors (lenders).\u000aThe effects of inflation can be lessened if people expect it (anticipated inflation), since then they can get a chance to prepare for the damages that the inflation may cause. For example, a person who has a fixed nominal income can try to adjust it if they know\u000athat its value is going to decrease. Many unions have labor contracts with cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) clauses, in which workers' wages increase if there is\u000ainflation.

VThe Efficient Markets Theory dictates that stock prices are always in accordance with relevant information. Therefore there can be know illogically low or high priced stock, because rational people will buy or sell the stock at a frequency which will create its optimal value.This could also be called "The Logical Prices Theory." A metaphor which can be used to explain this theory could be a congested high way. If all lanes are experiencing stop-and-go traffic, then you are better off staying in your own lane than changing lanes (excluding the possibility of accidents/roadwork which can bring traffic to a halt). If one lane is at a stand-still at one point, enough rational people will change lanes, that the apparently 'fast moving' lane, will eventually slow down, to the point where each lane is moving with equal speed.

SHOE leather costs - the increased costs of transactions caused by inflation\u000a- when their is a high inflation rate people do not like to hold onto their money because the purchasing power of the cash in your wallet and the funds in your bank account steadily diminishes as the overall level of prices rise.\u000a\u000a2. Menu Cost- the real costs of changing listed prices\u000a- when the inflation rate is high, merchants may decide to stop listing prices in terms of the local currency and use either an artificial unit (in effect, measuring prices relative to one another_ or a more stable currency such as the U.S. dollar\u000a- present in low-inflation economies (not severe)\u000a- businesses might update their prices sporadically (not daily or frequently)\u000a- menu costs are becoming less and less important with technology advances because fewer merchants attach price stickers to merchandise \u000a\u000a3. Unit-of-Account Costs- arise from the way inflation makes money a less reliable unit of measurement \u000a- role of the dollar is the basis for contracts and calculations\u000a- becomes degraded by inflation, which causes the purchasing power of a dollar to change over time (value keeps decreasing every year)\u000a- the effect is to reduce the quality of economic decisions\u000a- important in the tax system because inflation can distort the measures of income on which taxes are collected.

VA macroeconomic term used to describe the real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently in excess of its long-run average, or some other historical measure. Accordingly, the amount that the current real GDP is greater then the historic average is called an inflationary gap, as this will create inflationary pressures in this particular economy. A macroeconomic term used to describe a situation where an economy's short-run real gross domestic product (GDP) is currently lower than that same economy's long-run potential real GDP. Under this scenario, there is a recessionary gap between the two levels of GDP (measured by the difference between potential GDP and current GDP) that would have been produced had the economy been in long-run equilibrium.

sVLong-run aggregate demand & supply curve shifters
p46222
VUnlike the aggregate demand curve, the aggregate supply curve does not usually shift independently. This is because the equation for the aggregate supply curve contains no terms that are indirectly related to either the price level or output. Instead, the equation for aggregate supply contains only terms derived from the AS-AD model. For this reason, to understand how the aggregate supply curve shifts, we must work from the AS-AD model as a whole. depicts the AS-AD model. The intersection of the short-run aggregate supply curve, the long-run aggregate supply curve, and the aggregate demand curve gives the equilibrium price level and the equilibrium level of output. This is the starting point for all problems dealing with the AS- AD model. \u000aIn general, any expansionary policy shifts the aggregate demand curve to the right while any contractionary policy shifts the aggregate demand curve to the left. In the long run, though, since long-term aggregate supply is fixed by the factors of production, short-term aggregate supply shifts to the left so that the only effect of a change in aggregate demand is a change in the price level.

sVWhy are externalities referred to as "market failures?" Does the market system actually encourage this behavior? Identify two possible solutions to externalities.
p47136
VAn externality is a consequence of an industrial activity that affects other parties without this being reflected into the cost of the goods or services that are involved. They are often referred to as "market failures" because they can be inherent to the methods of production or other conditions that pose importance to the market as a whole. Pollution is the most common example of an externality and market failure. The market system does not actually encourage these behaviors - as seen clearly by the negative effects of pollution and lack of those positive. A possible solution to externalities would be the use of subsidies with the intent to correct economic imbalances. Another would be the use of government regulations in order to limit activities or things that may eventually result in these negative externalities.

sVEconomists worry quite a bit about efficiency in market types.\u000aa. How does an economist define allocative efficiency? What types of markets exhibit allocative efficiency?\u000a\u000ab. How does an economist define economic or productive efficiency? What types of markets exhibit economic efficiency?\u000a\u000ac. Provide a graph of a monopolistically competitive firm and identify the excess capacity on the graph.
p48478
Va. An economist would define allocative efficiency as being reached in production when marginal cost equals the price which in turn, equals the marginal revenue. By definition, it is a type of economic efficiency where the produces produce only those types of goods and services that are most desirable to and are in high demand with consumers. The types of markets that exhibit allocative efficiency are those that are perfectly competitive (free markets). \u000a \u000ab. Productive efficiency is measured, by economists, through the comparison of the amount of goods and services produced with the inputs that were used during production. Productivity can measured in several ways including, but not limited to: output per worker or hour of labor, output per hour/day/week, output per machine, or unit costs which is determined by total costs divided by total output. Economic efficiency, on the other hand, is measured by more subjective terms. It relies on assumptions about the social good created and its efficiency among the consumers with which it serves. Different market forces including the level of prices and employment and interest rates can all help to determine this economic efficiency. \u000a \u000ac. I emailed a copy of my graph.

sVAlaska king crab fishing in the 1960s and 70s was a dangerous but rich fishery. Boats from as far away as California and Japan braved the treacherous Gulf of Alaska crossing to reach the abundant king crab beds in Cook Inlet and Bristol Bay. Suddenly, in the early 1980s the fishery crashed due to over fishing. All crabbing in those areas ended. To this day, there is no crabbing in Bristol Bay or Cook Inlet.\u000a\u000aa. How would an economist explain the decline of the Alaska king crab fishery?\u000a\u000ab. Explain two programs you could institute to protect the fishery and still allow some crabbing again.\u000a\u000ac. Canadians have been very successful in farming salmon in coastal fiords along the coast of British Columbia. Why have they been successful with salmon when the crab fishery crashed?
p49060
Va. An economist would explain the decline of the Alaskan king crab fishery by explaining that the boats coming from so many different locations including California and Japan resulted in over-fishing which, in turn, decreased the supply of crabs throughout. As more people are fishing for the crabs, the supply goes down - as explained by the definition of a common good, which the crab is in this case. A common good is one that can run out (supply-wise) if it is over-used (in this case, over-fished) by the suppliers. \u000a \u000ab. In order to protect the fishery and still allow for some crabbing again, we could start the sale of fishing permits in order to put a restriction on fisherman coming for the crabs. This would stop a number of boats from coming in but would still allow for crabbing to be done by those who apply for the permits. Because of this, only the companies/boats with the highest willingness to pay will purchase the permits and there will be restrictions, allowing for the over-fishing to cease. Another program that could be instituted would also include the use of permits. However, in this case, the permits would be issued in a select amount and will allow for trade in an open market among the companies/fishermen. This will allow for the organization of economic activity and will protect the fishery while still allowing crabbing to occur.\u000a \u000ac. The Canadians have been successful in farming salmon in coastal fiords along the coast of British Columbia because there aren't a large amount of other countries coming to fish in this area. The Canadian government may impose restrictions or regulations on other countries coming to fish in these spots, therefore allowing for their fisherman to fish them at ease and prevent over-fishing. Because of this, the salmon can re-produce accordingly and increasing the number of salmon they can fish as a result. These restrictions/regulations will eventually allow for their market/industry to stay the same without fear of decreasing or over-fishing and ending like the crabbing in Bristol Bay or Cook Inlet

sVJessica Simpson sets up shop to sell "Buffalo Wings." She observes that if the price drops from $3.50 per order to $2.50 per order, her daily sales rise from 300 to 500 orders.\u000aA. What is the price elasticity of demand for Jessica's "Buffalo wings?"\u000a\u000aB. Which price yields the greater total revenue?\u000a\u000aC. Jessica is considering adding a new product, widgets, to the menu. She has experimented and discovered that a 10% increase in the price of wings causes a 20% increase in the quantity of widgets sold. What is the cross elasticity of demand between widgets and wings? Are they complements or substitutes??\u000a\u000aD. What is the difference between the price elasticity of demand and the slope of the demand curve? Are they the same concept? Are they even related concepts?
p49336
VA. The price elasticity of demand for Jessica's "Buffalo Wings" is +2.333. \u000a \u000aB. The price that yields the greater total revenue is $2.50. This may seem odd because how would someone earn more if something is being sold for less. However, when the price was $3.50, Jessica was receiving 300 orders and therefore $1050 in revenue. When she lowered her price to $2.50, she received 500 orders and $1250 in total revenue. \u000a \u000aC. Jessica's cross elasticity of demand between widgets and wings is 2. Widgets and wings are substitutes meaning they exhibit a positive cross elasticity of demand. When a good's (wings) price is increased, the demand of another good (widgets) increases.\u000a \u000aD. The slope of a demand curve, whether it is flat or steep, is based solely upon absolute changes in price as well as quantity. The price elasticity of demand, on the other hand, is concerned with relative changes in price and quantity. They are definitely related concepts because they both represent changes in price and quantity. However, they are NOT the same concept as they can have varying results.
