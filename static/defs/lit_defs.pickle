VThe contrast between what is stated explicitly and what is really meant. The difference between what appears to be and what actually is true. In general, there are three major types of irony used in language; (1) In verbal irony, the words literally state the opposite of the writer's (or speaker's) true meaning. (2) In situational irony, events turn out the opposite of what was expected. What the characters and readers think ought to happen is not what does happen. (3) In dramatic irony, facts or events are unknown to a character in a play or piece of fiction but known to the reader, audience, or other characters in the work. Irony is used for many reasons, but frequently, it's used to create poignancy or humor.

Word spread of the beauty of Psyche so men left Venus;s alter (Aphrodite) and were now worshiping Psyche instead. Angry that she was losing to a mortal, Venus told her son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a hideous beast. Sneaking into her room at night Cupid was ready to prick Psyche with his arrow but was distracted by her beauty and startled that she was able to see him, Cupid prick himself with his own arrow. He abandoned his plans and fled the scene. Psyche was left alone despite her beauty and her two sisters were off now happily married. The king and queen asked Apollo for help because they feared their daughter upset the gods. Apollo told them that their daughter was meant to have no mortal lover. They sent her to be with her husband who awaited her, she stayed with him but was never allowed to see his face. A visit from her sisters drove Psyche to sneak into her husband's room and kill the "monster." She found out that it was cupid who was her secret husband and he felt betrayed by her not trusting him and her sisters instead so he left her. She was miserable and in order to find him again she went to be a servant for Venus herself; Venus sent her to get a box filled with Proserpine's beauty. Psyche opened the box to only be put into a Stygian sleep. Cupid recovered from his wound went to Jupiter and pleaded for Psyche's recovery. Jupiter then granted Psyche immortality and the two were then married and eventually had a daughter named Pleasure.

VSince Prometheus stole the fire that was supposed to be given to the Gods, Zeus became angry and wanted to find revenge by punishing the people. So Pandora, the first women on earth, was created as a punishment to mankind, who was given gifts from the Gods. Hephaestus shaped her perfectly, Aphrodite gave her femininity, Athena taught her crafts, and Hermes taught her to be deceitful, stubborn, and curious. She was given a box that contained "special gifts" according to the Gods, but was told that she was never allowed to open it. One day Hermes took Pandora to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus to become his wife. Although Prometheus warned his brother to not receive anything from the gods, he was astonished by her beauty and accepted the offer. Pandora's curiosity got the best of her, which led to the opening of the box that illnesses and hardships that the Gods hid. She closed the box quickly to keep the evil spirits from coming out closed hope inside instead. Zeus' goal was to make mankind understand to not disrespect the Gods and Pandora was the right person because of her curiosity.\u000a\u000aWhen people refer to the phrase, "to open Pandora's box" it means to complete an action that may seem innocent, with no effect, but in reality that small action leads to severe consequences.

Su amigo lleva su féretro a la Ciudad de México en autobús. En el camino, su amigo comenzó a leer su diario. Las primeras páginas del diario presentaban la vida de Filiberto y su anhelo de comprarse una réplica del Chac Mool. Cuando al fin la adquirió, la depositó en su sótano y desde entonces comenzaron a ocurrir sucesos extraños en la vida de Filiberto. La estatua cobró vida e hizo de Filiberto su esclavo para que lo mantuviera. Filiberto aprovechó que estaba debilitándose para huir. Cuando el amigo de Filiberto terminó de leer su diario pensó que había enloquecido. Sin embargo, cuando llegó a la casa de Filiberto se encontró con un indio amarillo parecido al Chac Mool que le ordenó que colocara el cadáver de Filiberto en el sótano. El cuento sugiere que por más que evolucione nuestra cultura no debemos olvidar nuestra historia y los elementos que caracterizan nuestra sociedad.

sVLa Siesta del Martes; Gabriel Garcia Marquez
p1341
VGénero: Prosa- Cuento \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom -Realismo mágico\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aEl relato tiene de trasfondo la industria bananera de la costa norte de Colombia. Estas empresas eran conocidas por la explotación de sus trabajadores. Ese código de injusticia se ve repetido en muchos de los temas del relato. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aRepresentación feminista: Aunque "La siesta del martes" no contiene un mensaje feminista tan fuerte como "Dos palabras", sí pinta a una madre fuerte, digna y determinada que jamás critica o lucha por sus derechos como mujer y madre.\u000aRealismo: mientras que la mayoría de los autores del siglo XX experimentaron con la narración en prosa , no abandonaron por completo el realismo , como se ilustra en " ¿ No se oyes ladrar los perros ? " por Rulfo y" La siesta del martes " por García Márquez .\u000aRelaciones sociales e interpersonales: \u000aGarcía Márquez relata cómo la pobreza puede llevar a la gente a la delincuencia. Carlos roba por necesidad. Esto es un eco del padre y del padrastro de Lazarillo, quienes también robaban por necesidad. La completa objetividad del narrador de "La siesta del martes", que nos revela toda la triste realidad de la pobreza en Hispanoamérica y la indiferencia muchas veces de la iglesia y de la gente rica.\u000aVoz narrativa: Es completamente objetiva: cuenta sin comentar. Descripción detallista: La larga descripción al principio del camino que toma el tren por las fincas bananeras. \u2022 Pinta un cuadro muy completo y vivo. En García Márquez parece que siempre hay un subtexto oculto. \u000aSignos: \u000aSocio-económico:Viajan en un vagón de tercera clase. \u000aCarácter de la madre: su pujanza en insistir que el cura le deje ir al camposanto, su fortaleza, su dignidad \u000aCarácter del cura: su falta de piedad, su superficialidad, etc. \u000aAmbiente-Calor: es agobiante. Se menciona constantemente. \u000aCausa de la muerte: Realmente no sabemos 100% si Carlos fue a la casa de Rebeca para robar ya que el narrador no lo dice. Llovía mucho esa noche y llevaba una soga de cinturón y estaba descalzo. Si realmente fuera una ladrón quizá tuviera zapatos. \u000aSignificado de las últimas palabras de Carlos: "Ay, mi madre". Al saber que muere, recuerda a su madre y sabe lo que le va a pasar a su muerte y que ya no tendrá sostén. Carlos robaba para mantener a la familia. \u000aNi Rebeca ni el sacerdote muestra ningún remordimiento por el asesinato del ladrón ya que él es nada más que un ladrón y un pobre, una vida que no vale nada.

Vrefers to the collection of literary movements that have developed in the decades following WWII. Others, however, have focused on creating works that stand apart form the literature of the past. To accomplish these purposes, writers have experimented with a variety of different approaches and used a wide range of literary forms and techniques. Possessing the belief that reality is to some extent shaped by our imaginations, some writers have turned away from writing realistic fiction and begun writing fantasy or "magical realism"--fiction that blends realism and fantasy. Some Postmodernists have confronted the problems they perceive in modern society through the use of satire and black humor.

As the traveler uses the staff in the story, he is using it to support people with evil and relying on evil to carry him through his life.

p1571
VGénero: Teatro \u000aSiglo: XVII\u000aMovimiento: Comedia del Siglo de Oro (tres unidades)\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aDepiction of the role of women and the relationship between the sexes in Golden Age Spain. In order to seduce women, Don Juan must promise matrimony, because a woman during this period who had lost her virginity\u2014 albeit by no fault of her own\u2014was not eligible for marriage and had no alternative but to enter a convent. Don Juan's actions, therefore, destroy women's lives. And he has no compunction about dishonoring women, because he feels that his noble status and his superiority as a man gives him the privilege. Women have absolutely no voice in this period. They are pawns of men, and the king marries them off to whomever he wishes, without their consent. The play also has somewhat of a feminist theme, as two of the dishonored women, on their way to seek justice from the king, say "¡mal haya la mujer que en hombres fía!" \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl burlador de Sevilla es una obra religiosa en que Tirso expresa su postura frente al debate del acto de contrición que decía que si se confesaba sinceramente los pecados antes de morir, la salvación se aseguraba. Claramente, Tirso era de otra opinión. \u000aPrimera Jornada: Trama y desenlace \u2192 Don Juan ha deshonrado a Isabela. Si el duque se entera que Isabela no es pura, no querrá casarse con ella, pero el único modo de recobrar su honra es el matrimonio. \u000aNoción hacia las mujeres: Que las mujeres son inconstantes, débiles. (En los versos 155-56 también dice que las mujeres son inconstantes). \u000aIronía dramática: Tisbea dice que a ella no le afecta el amor como a otras chicas; desdeña a los hombres. Sin embargo, se enamora enseguida de don Juan. \u000aOposición fónica: "Aliento y tormento"---> Riman en consonancia, y cada palabra tiene un sentido diferente; "aliento", por ejemplo, es "respiración" y también "esfuerzo y valor". O sea, para una persona que apenas respira, don Juan tiene mucho valor y es muy atrevido. \u2022 Además de tempestad, significa "angustia". \u2022 Don Juan llega frío del mar (casi muerto), pero sus palabras de amor son muy ardientes. \u2022 Don Juan hace el amor ("fuego"), pero luego se huye sin cumplir su promesa ("frío"). \u000aJornada Segunda : \u000aMatrimonio forzado del duque Octavio y Ana: No puede negarse al deseo del rey. También, no le importa con quién se case mientras sea una 'buena pieza'. \u000aDiscurso religioso: Don Diego die que Dios lo va a castigar a don Juan por sus delitos. \u2022 "Tan largo me lo fiáis". (Queda mucho hasta la muerte). \u2022 Lo repite a lo largo del drama. Don Juan cree que como es joven, no va a morir pronto y tiene tiempo para enmendarse. Los pecados: No obedecer a su padre; aprovechase de su rango social; engañar a las mujeres; mentir, prometiéndoles matrimonio sabiendo que lo que hace las destruye; infringe las leyes de la amistad; mata a don Gonzalo; etc. \u000aJornada tercera: \u000aCena con don Gonzalo: Le dan de cenar culebras y alacranes. Cantan una canción con referencia a los errores de don Juan, y este por primera vez siente miedo. Don Gonzalo le toma por la mano y don Juan siente que se abrasa y pide confesión, pero es demasiado tarde. Don Juan se abrasa en el infierno. \u000aPetición de don Juan antes de morir: \u000aPide confesión y absolución pero es demasiado tarde; nunca en vida intentó remediarse. "Es justicia de Dios: quien tal hace que tal pague". \u000aLa muerte de don Juan resuelve muchos problemas para el rey ya que ahora puede casarse Mota con Ana y Octavio con Isabela.

VAutor: Francisco de Quevedo\u000aÉpoca:\u000aTema: Tiempo y espacio: Tema y técnica\u000aResumen: El poeta hace referencia a España, su país, y cuenta que ahora se ve debilitada y derrumbada pero antes era gloriosa y fuerte. Se refiere a que su país ya desgastado por tanto malestar ya no da más y deja su fuerzas de lado. Luego, el personaje contempla los campos y la naturaleza olvidándose de su melancolía. Se hace oscuro y lo que encontraba sereno y bello se torna tan desalentado y rendido como su patria. Contempla la estropeada habitación de su hogar hecha pedazos, ya no es un lugar acogedor para él. Se ve derrotado por el paso del tiempo, pierde las esperanzas y se ve sin salida. Se encuentra solo, sin opción que enfrentar la muerte, lo único que le queda. En conclusión, en el poema el autor hace una reflexión de toda la situación en la que se encuentra, en la realidad y en el poema. Lamenta el estado en que se encuentra su patria pero luego se da cuenta que ese problema exterior se vuelve personal y se encuentra tan mal como esta el país, desgastado, viejo, solo dejado a la muerte.

Por contraste, el poeta azteca de "Se ha perdido el pueblo Mexicatl" expresa sentimientos muy semejantes a los que expresara un europeo al perder su nación y su identidad. \u2022 Nosotros los lectores encontramos muy raras las imágenes, la lógica y las supersticiones descritas en "Los presagios", precisamente porque somos de otra cultura. \u000a"Se ha perdido el pueblo Mexicatl" -This lament expresses the deep pain and frustration of the loss of the Mexican homeland to Spanish conquistadores.

sVEl caballo mago
p2541
VAutor: Sabine Ulibarrí\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La imaginación y la creación literaria\u000aResumen: Este cuento se trata de un hombre contando una experiencia que pasó cuando tenía quince años. Cuando era niño, estaba obsesionado con un caballo blanco, el cual llenó su juventud de fanatsía y poesía. También todo el pueblo estaba fascinado con este animal. Hablaron de él con entusiasmo y admiración por que era libre y nadie lo pudo controlar. La historia toma lugar en un campo cerca de un pueblo pequeño. El narrador sólo lo vio dos veces en su vida. La primera vez que lo vio fue durante el verano. El narrador sintió una "eternidad momentánea" o sea sólo duró un momento pero nunca lo olvidará. Desde entonces, el caballo mago cambió sus sueños, llenándolos de resonancia, luz, y violencia. Cuando llego el invierno, la gente del pueblo comentaba que el caballo había regresado y que adaba por algún rincon. Por lo cual, al narrador le se le hacía más ideal y misterioso.\u000aCuando lo vio por segunda vez, se vieron al mismo tiempo y se quedaron inmóviles. El narrador lo siguió, observando las manchas negras que tenía en su cuerpo. Entonces, el narrador lo trató de lazar y se le hizo mucho más fácil de lo que había pensado. Aunque se sintió verdugo, lo hizo por que era su sueño desde que era niño. Despúes de haberlo lazado, se sintió conquistador. Cuando pasó con el mago por el pueblo, el caballo trató de escapar pero se caía. Allí el narrador se sintió mal por el caballo pero siguió por el camino hacía su casa. Llegaron a la casa del narrador y él decidio dejar el mago en un potrero, donde ningún caballo se había escapado. El narrador no durmió bien esa noche por estar pensando en el mago. Cuando se despertó, no encontraba el caballo por ningún lado. Se puso nervioso al darse cuenta que el mago había brincado la cerca de alambre de púas. Vio que al otro lado de la cerca había huellas con gotas de sangre y se puso a llorar. Despúes de un rato, apareció su padre y le puso el brazo sobre el hombro y se quedaron viendo las huellas del mago.

p2693
VGenerally, anything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete -- such as an object, action, character, or scene - that represents something more abstract. However, symbols (1) natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to symbolize ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge). (2) conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scale of justice for lawyers). (3) literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are more generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated, as is the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

VPollyanna by Eleanor H. Porter - (1913 novel) classical of children's literature, first of later sequel\u000a\u000aPollyanna Whittier is a young orphan who is sent to live with her wealthy but austere aunt in Vermont after her dad has past away. Her aunt is not fond in taking Pollyanna in but feels that it is her duty to her late sister. Pollyanna's philosophy allows her to get through life under her aunt's household and make new friends in town. Her philosophy centers on the "Glad Game," an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father through an incident on Christmas. She was hoping for a doll, but instead received crutches. Her father told her to look at the good side, "we didn't need to use them," and she makes up the game on the spot. Her optimism is put to the test when she is struck by an automobile and becomes paralyzed from her legs. Unable to find things to be glad about the townspeople encourage her and she becomes glad that she at least has had her legs. She eventually learns to walk again and be appreciative of her legs.\u000a\u000aBeing called or calling others a "Pollyanna" refers to a personality type characterized by optimism evident even at the most discouraging circumstances.

El caballo adquiere una serie de significados simbólicos que \u000aun niño debe aprender a convertirse en un hombre. Más allá del simbolismo sexual evidente , el caballo es también un \u000aideal , una meta inalcanzable, la belleza de lo intangible , etc.\u000aCaballo blanco: Todos lo admiran; cuentan muchas historias de él; todos han intentado capturarlo, pero ninguno lo ha logrado\u000aNarrador: El chico. Narra en primera persona. \u2022 Son recuerdos, pero narra en el presente. Transformación de la narrativa: Con el tiempo se suavizan, se exageran, se idealizan, etc. El recuerdo es demasiado poético; se basa en reminiscencias idealizadas por el tiempo\u000aEstilo: Es un estilo poético. Las oraciones son cortas y a veces fragmentadas. Hay mucha adjetivación. La naturaleza se humaniza y personifica. Hay muchos recursos poéticos: metáforas y símiles como en el primer párrafo; epíteto (al llamar al caballo "el brujo"); personificación ("el bosque se calla"); graduación ("al atraparlo se volvía espuma y aire y nada"); paradoja ("lloraba de alegría); ,etc. No es un estilo realista porque todo se idealiza y poetiza. No hay problemas económicos, sociales o morales como suele haber en los discursos realistas. \u000aRecursos poéticos: \u000aSímil: "libre como la alegría" \u000agradación y polisíndeton: "al atraparlo se volvía espuma, y aire, y nada"\u000aProsopopeya, personificación: "De pronto el bosque se calla"\u000aParadoja, oxímoron: "La eternidad momentánea" \u000aParadoja, ironía: "Lloraba de alegría"\u000aSimbolismo: Caballo- La belleza, lo inefable, lo imposible, la virilidad, etc. \u2022 El caballo como viril es un emblema en la literatura. Es el macho semental de una majada de yeguas. En el cuento todos los hombres lo admiran. \u000a El narrador tiene quince años y está experimentando la pubertad; quiere ser como el caballo semental para, como dice, "lucirlo . . . cuando las muchachas salen a paseo por la calle".

Le asignaron diez pesos de sueldo, la casilla y la comida. Al principio no podía agacharse para entrar a la casilla pero se fue acostumbrando. Su trabajo era gritar cuando alguien mirara a alguien Dejo ese empleo y trato de encontrar otro pero no le fue posible. Y otra vez acepto ser un perro vigilante pero con un sueldo un poco más alto; quince pesos. El acepto el empleo con la esperanza de que cuando un obrero se jubilara; lo emplearan a él. El tiempo pasó y su cuerpo se fue acostumbrando a andar ágatas. Trato de pararse pero sus piernas estaban my débiles y no podo muy bien. María estaba embarazada y tenía miedo tener a su hijo. El hombre siguió así; haciendo como perro y ya no sabía si era hombre o era perro.

Cain was born first and worked as a farmer, Abel worked as a shepherd. Their parents asked them to sacrifice a lamb in order to show god that they were sorry for their mistakes. Cain offered fresh fruit from the ground, but Abel offered the fat portion of the firstborn. God advised Cain to do the same in order to gain the same respect as Abel but Cain was not satisfied and ended up killing his own brother in the fields. God now saw Cain as a sinner and son of the devil. God cursed Cain and told him he is not allowed to be a farmer and would become a wanderer. "Driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand." God would punish him by making Cain live with guilt his whole life. Cain wanted a much more severe punishment but god's gracefulness protected Cain from getting killed by the people. Cain created a city and his people had no knowledge of god.

sVlimited point of view or focus
p3275
Va perspective pinned to a single character, whether a first-person-or a third-person-centered consciousness, so that we cannot know for sure what is going on in the minds of other characters; thus, when the focal character leaves the room in a story we must go, too, and cannot know what is going on while our "eyes" or "camera" is gone. A variation on this, which generally has no name and is often lumped with the omniscient point of view, is the point of view that can wander like a camera from one character to another and close in or move back but cannot (or at least does not) get inside anyone's head and does not present from the inside any character's thoughts.

p3353
VIt is a medieval text in Spain and it is a collection of stories. After a man and a woman get married, the man feels like he has all of the power and feels like the wife cannot serve him just like the animals cannot serve him. He treats the position of the woman as if she was one of the animals as well. She has a reputation of not listening to her husband either. The story is very chauvinistic and it shows the TRADITIONAL gender roles at the time. One of the major themes to take away from this story is that if you cannot show what you want or who you are at the beginning, then you will never be able to show that feeling later in the long run. The story is in a modern perspective.

Dionysus had two natures, one that brought Joy and Ecstasy and the other is brutal and has Blinding rage, which is how people could be when they drink wine. Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Semele, a mortal, but did not know she was being seduced by Zeus. When she was tricked by Hera to ask for one wish from her lover, which was to show his true self, innocently asked Zeus and when she saw him and all his glory, she died. Luckily, Zeus saved Dionysus by stitching him into his thigh. Hera, wife of Zeus, was jealous and had the titans kill him, but he was saved and then protected by his father. He would then roam the world, have followers, and drink a lot of wine, but for spiritual reasons. He was also able to bring his mother back from the underworld, something that is almost impossible. So, he was known for rebirth after death, surviving the titans, and the belief that you could gain great power from drinking wine.\u000a\u000aI would have to say that this shows that people could be two faced or at least have different personalities. You might be nice and energetic with some people, but aggressive and bitter with others. Also, the sudden changes in personality when someone drinks.\u000a\u000aWhen people associate with Bacchus, they would allude him as either a wild drunken party or celebration with wine, referred to as Bacchanal.

Se le considera uno de los mayores cuentistas del idioma español. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aLas relaciones familiares entre los padres e hijos: los padres tienen amor incondicional a sus hijos y mantienen una comunicación abierta con ellos.\u000aVoz narrativa: Es completamente objetivo. Nunca interpreta las acciones de los personajes. Solamente las cuenta. \u000aEstilo: Capta el habla sobrio y melódico del campesino mexicano. Espacio: Es también un paisaje parco y seco. \u000aSimbolismo: Luna/ Sol\u2192 El sol alumbra el lugar para salvar al hijo; durante la noche están perdidos. Algunos críticos han especulado que la luna es la madre, que lo alumbra. Tonaya significa en una lengua indígena "sol"\u000aPresencia de la madre: El padre la recuerda constantemente; ella existe en la memoria. \u2022 Relación de los padres era íntima, de mucho amor; el padre la extraña mucho. \u000aForma de Usted/Tú: Hace el cambio cuando se enoja con el hijo. \u2022 La forma de usted crea distancia entre los dos, como si el padre apenas conociera al hijo. Pero sus últimas palabras usa la forma de tú, la forma familiar. \u000aÚltimas palabras del padre: "No me ayudaste ni siquiera en esta esperanza". \u2022 El padre, a pesar de lo que ha dicho, ha tenido la esperanza de salvar al hijo. Fuerte amor del padre: El padre lo lleva cargado (es una carga que el padre está dispuesto a aguantar); el hijo le pide que lo baje y lo abandone, y posiblemente llora. \u000aLágrimas o sangre (la gota que le cae en la frente al padre): El padre prefiere que sea una lágrima porque sería una confesión y arrepentimiento por sus pecados. Parte de la salvación que busca el padre no es solo lo físico sino lo espiritual. Al arrepentirse, Ignacio se salva. \u000aFinal: Muerte del hijo \u2192 por la descripción de que al bajarse de los hombros estaba como descoyuntado y el padre tiene que destrabar los dedos del hijo de su cuello.

VGénero: Prosa- Apología\u000aSiglo: XV - Edad Media\u000aMovimiento: Apología\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aEl conde Lucanor; like its models, it uses a frame story to tie the tales together. This represents but one example of the many ideas of Arab culture introduced into Europe via Spain.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aConstrucción de género: El conde Lucanor, por medio de las diferentes interpretaciones del relato que cuenta Patronio (la necesidad de domar a las mujeres y que uno debe darse a conocer al principio de una relación), subraya la complejidad del acto comunicativo: un mismo mensaje puede ser recibido de diferentes modos por diferentes destinatarios\u000aFábula: El conde Lucanor le plantea una situación a su criado Patronio, a propósito de la cual Patronio narra la anécdota de cómo un joven moro logró dominar el mal carácter de su esposa.\u000aApología: La mujer debe llegar virgen al matrimonio\u000a- Un narrador narra la primera línea del cuento \u000aNarrador(es): El autor implícito parece concebir un discurso sobre las mujeres insoportables, y el autor explícito escribe otra moraleja. La necesidad de domar y dominar a la mujer. \u2022 Que te debes dar a conocer desde el principio. \u2022 Cada destinatario interpreta los códigos de un modo diferente. \u000aEl destinatario (narratario)de Patronio es El conde. Filtros de narración: Emisión original escuchada por Patronio emitida de nuevo por Patronio al conde, el conde escribe su interpretación. Este problema forma la base de toda la narratología moderna, y ya era preocupación de la narrativa en el siglo XIV y se verá repetido en Don Quijote: ¿quién narra la historia?; ¿qué limitaciones tiene el narrador?; cuáles son sus fuentes de comunicación; ¿se puede confiar en lo que dice?. En fin, ¿cuál es la realidad?

VAutor: Tomás Rivera\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: En esta obra, un niño narra sus vivencias y las de otros trabajadores migrantes. El autor nos presenta la vida de los campesinos de Texas durante la década de 1950 con todos sus pesares y alegrías. Es una recreación de la dificultosa vida de los inmigrantes mexicanos y sus descendientes, que llegaban a ese país en busca de trabajo y una esperanza para el futuro. El narrador es un joven perdido en las sombras de la explotación laboral y la mistificación de su vida por las instituciones de la sociedad. En el capítulo seleccionado, el padre es llevado a la casa debido al exceso de sol que le hizo vomitar y retorcerse de calambres mientras trabajaba toda la familia en el campo. Hasta el más pequeño de nueve años sufria las consecuencias del arduo trabajo. Sólo esperaba el nuevo dia para continuar su rutina de trabajo. El personaje-narrador desafía a la tierra: "la tierra no se come a nadie, ni el sol tampoco"/ "todavia no me puedes tragar. Algún día, sí. Pero yo ni sabré". Esta escena denota un momento de rebeldía en la vida del adolescente.

Los intelectuales hispanoamericanos vieron esta guerra como un acto de agresión del gran país del norte para apoderarse de todo Hispanoamérica.

Revise your paper, which may require a rewriting of the paper or of certain aspects of the paper. \u000a5. Continue revising, and make sure all your stances are firm and forthright and now weak and wishy-washy.\u000a6. Revise your paper for effectiveness of expression. \u000a7.

This tells the story of a young Venetian named Bassanio who needs to borrow money so that he can impress Portia, a wealthy Venetian heiress. Antonio, his good friend and merchant, does not have the money to lend him because it is invested in his fleet which is at sea. He suggests that Bassanio borrow the money from Shylock, a wealthy Jewish man, and use his name to give him a good word. Shylock agrees to the loan but if the money is not paid back in three months, Antonio must give Shylock a pound of his flesh. Antonio agrees confident that he will have the money but two of his ships are later wrecked and once the three months come to an end, he does not have the money. Shylock demands the pound of flesh immediately partially because his daughter ran away to marry a Christian. At the "trial" a random lawyer and clerk, secretly Portia and Nerissa in disguise, defend Antonio and say that Shylock may only remove the flesh if he can do it without slipping the blood of a Christian. Since this is impossible Shylock leaves with nothing.

sVDeconstructionist
p6387
VA critical theory, literary works do not yield fixed, single meanings. Deconstruction, form of philosophical and literary analysis, derived mainly from work begun in the 1960s by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, that questions the fundamental conceptual distinctions, or "oppositions," in Western philosophy through a close examination of the language and logic of philosophical and literary texts. In the 1970s the term was applied to work by Derrida, Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, and Barbara Johnson, among other scholars. In the 1980s it designated more loosely a range of radical theoretical enterprises in diverse areas of the humanities and social sciences. In polemical discussions about intellectual trends of the late 20th-century, deconstruction was sometimes used pejoratively to suggest nihilism and frivolous skepticism. In popular usage the term has come to mean a critical dismantling of tradition and traditional modes of thought.

VGénero: Poesía \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardia española - Generación del 98 \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGeneración del 98: Grupo de novelistas, poetas, ensayistas y filósofos españoles, activos durante y después de la Guerra de Cuba (1898), que restauraron a España a una prominencia intelectual y literaria. Les era de gran importancia definir a España como una entidad cultural e histórica.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDivisiones socioeconómicas: Antonio Machado, "He andado muchos caminos," talks about the presumptuous upper classes and compares them with the simple life of Spanish peasants. \u000aEl enigma de la existencia: Machado pits two types of people, which together represent humanity for the poet. One group is educated and sophisticated, and the other is simple and unpretentious. The elite group is viewed as pompous and unhappy, while the simple folks are content. The famous poem also expresses doubt in the immortality of the soul, ending with the fact that someday these folks "descansan bajo la tierra"\u2014not in heaven.\u000a"La gente mala"= ricos: Son tristes, soberbias, melancólicas, presuntuosas, farsantes ("al paño") y arrogantes (creen que saben lo que es el buen vivir). \u000aGente pobre: Danzan, juegan, trabajan, no son ambiciosos ni mezquinos ni arrogantes (toman cualquier vino), etc\u000aA pesar de su admiración por la gente pobre no deja de incluir signos de su triste realidad: Cabalgan en mulas viejas, solo tienen cuatro palmos de tierra, repite el verbo "laborar" dos veces. \u000aExperiencia de la vida (yo lírico): Utiliza verbos de diferentes actividades: andar, abrir, navegar, atracar. \u000aForma métrica: Octosílabo, rima asonante con patrón e/a en versos pares\u000aEl encabalgamiento: no permite que la voz pare al fin del verso; por lo tanto, no se enfatiza la rima. Al seguir rápidamente al próximo verso, no se oye la rima. Entonces suena más a prosa que a poesía

sVSoneto CLXVI/ Mientras por competir con tu cabello; Luis de regote Gongora
p8039
VGénero: Lírica - Soneto\u000aSiglo: XVII\u000aMovimiento: Siglo de Oro- Barroco \u2192 Culteranismo \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aMovimiento cultural español (1580-1700) caracterizado por su complejidad y su extravagante ornamentación, cuyo propósito era asombrar e incitar introspección. Góngora's poem "Mientras por competir con tu cabello" conforms to the same pattern but is a product of the Baroque. The emphasis in Góngora is much more in death than just growing old. He combines the theme of memento mori, with its dark, cynical undercurrent. It also includes much more culteranismo, making the sonnet more convoluted owing to its Baroque heritage. These two poems form a nice contrast for comparing the Renaissance to the Baroque.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTema: Carpe Diem (disfrutar la vida porque llega la muerte) \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE.\u000aHiberbatos (2nd cuarteto): Mientras más ojos siguen tus labios para cogerlos que los que siguen al clavel temprano. \u2022 Los hombres miran tus labios más que al clavel temprano (metonimia para "capullo del clavel", o sea, clavel sin brotar, joven, virgen) para cogerlos (gozar de ellos en su sentido erótico).\u000aMetonimia: Naturaleza- Cabello/oro, frente/lilio, labios/clavel, cuello/luciente cristal\u000aSinécdoque: Edad dorada = La juventud. (1er terceto)\u000a2ndo terceto: Colores \u2192 Plata, violeta débil \u2192 se asocia con la muerte (la tez después de muerto). \u000aSubtexto - Verbos 'coger' y 'gozar' Tienen sentido erótico, como se vio en el soneto de Garcilaso. \u2022 La virginidad de la mujer (flor sin brotar o abrirse). \u000aAnáfora: No se emplea la misma palabra en versos consecutivos, sino a principios de una nueva idea.\u000aAliteración: Crean efectos fónicos y musicales\u2192 Los sonidos bilabiales ('m', 'p' y 'b') en el primer verso: "Mientras por competir con tu cabello"\u000aNo se emplea la misma palabra en versos consecutivos, sino a principios de una nueva idea.\u000a Asyndeton: where the prepositions or articles are purposely omitted. An example can also be found in the Góngora poem where he writes "goza cuello, cabello, labio y frente" in stead of "goza del cuello, del cabello, del labio y de la frente," especially as the final noun is feminine while the others are masculine.

Alexander the Great is one of the most greatest rulers in ancient history, no pun intended. As a young boy, his father, Philip, hired one of the most well known Greek philosophers of our time to tutor Alexander. Aristotle's method of teaching is the key strategy Alexander used to conquer. Instead of forcing the Greek culture on the people he conquered, he simply introduced it to them, his friendly approach is what made him be admired by the inhabitants. Alexander's conquests touched three different continents. These continents are the only continents that humans at the time knew of. Alexander died at the age of 32 in Babylon of malaria.

He knows that the fictional work has a title, like most fictional work does, and reading it causes him to freak out.\u000a2. He is aware that when the reader turns the page, that takes the book closer to the end, and he begs, pleads, and builds barriers to try and keep the reader from turning the pages and moving along the fictional story.\u000a\u000aIn both cases, Grover's ability to see these elements that are part of fictional stories are metafictional examples.

Animals who figure importantly in movies of live drama are considered characters. Lassie and Tarzan's monkey Cheetah are examples.

V-one version of Catch-22 keeps Yossarian flying combat mission after combat mission: Doc Daneeka cannot ground him for insanity unless he asks, but if he asks to be grounded, then he must be sane\u000a-in this sense, Catch-22 is a piece of circular reasoning that keeps Yossarian trapped in a paradox that determines whether he lives or dies, even though it is made only of words\u000a-Catch-22 has many other permutations, most notably in the final, general principle stated by the old Italian woman in the ruined brothel: "they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing"\u000a-this description of Catch-22 proves what Yossarian has known all along: Catch-22 does not really exist\u000a-it is just a name made up for an illogical argument that justifies what is really going on\u000a-behind Catch-22 stands an unswerving principle: might makes right\u000a-Catch-22 also manifests itself even when it is not explicitly named\u000a-both the doctor and the Chaplain have been caught up in their own versions of Catch-22, since war drastically undermines the premises of their professions and yet calls upon them to practice those professions in the name of war\u000a-even Heller's style is in a way a Catch-22; the dialogue leaps haphazardly from one comment to another, often arriving at a point exactly opposite of that which the person speaking is trying to express\u000a\u000a**Catch-22 Definition**\u000aA dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.

Thisbe screams and runs, leaving her shawl behind. Pyramus arrives a little while later and finds the bloody lioness ripping apart the shawl. Uh oh\u2014we can see where this is headed.\u000aAssuming Thisbe has been devoured, he stabs himself with his sword. Later, Thisbe returns, figures out the horrible thing that's happened, and stabs herself with Pyramus's sword, too. To this day, the formerly white berries of the mulberry tree are stained red with the blood of these tragic lovers.\u000aMeaning: \u000aThe story of Pyramus and Thisbe demonstrates the effect of the love of two-star crossed lovers. The effect that two parents/families hatred can affect the love of two persons. In addition, they are forced to hide and turn something positive into something negative; actions have consequences.

sVtraditional wisdom
p9073
Vwhen a wrong or an unsuitable practice is justified on grounds that it follows a traditional accepted way of doing things. It is difficult for some people to change because change brings risks, inevitably. (ie: not wanting to eliminate biased practices based on gender, racial, or religious biases because that's the way things have ALWAYS been done in the "good ole days."). Those who benefit from these practices find it hard to entertain the idea that there could possibly be anything wrong with them. We do want to learn from past experiences, so we shouldn't assume that just because things have been done in the past, that it is right to do that thing NOW. All innovations go against past practices (From the introduction of plows that dig deeper furrows (a practice resisted at first by the North African farmers) to the elimination of practices based on racial, religious, or gender bias in the US). Tradition should be a guide not a jailer. Jeremy Bentham once said that when someone is guilty of abuse of power, the ONLY way for them to defend that abuse is to use a fallacy. Therefore it is important for them to keep the people stupid so that they can't distinguish truth from error.(under Two Wrongs category)

He sticks through it all even when he realizes he's losing her but a she soon realizes the life she was accustomed to wasn't part of her. Even though she didn't gain her memory back they got to fall in love all over again(benefit). The idea of devotion was represented in many religions and in this story God had payed a visit to Abraham testing his devotion to him which ended up with him agreeing to sacrifice his child. Abraham and Isaac had set forth on a trip to worship god but Isaac hadn't realized he was the lamb for this sacrifice. Abraham loaded his donkey and went forth with his son and two servants to the mountain. After leaving behind the servants, Isaac and Abraham started the fire and Isaac spoke up questioning where the lamb to sacrifice was. Abraham answered "god will provide it for us". As Abraham was beginning the sacrifice and angel called out to him, telling him not to lay a hand on his child for god has realized his devotion to killing his son, his only son. The angel called from heaven a second time saying that for his devotion god has agreed that he will be blessed and his descendants will be many, his children will take the land of his enemies and will be blessed since he had obeyed him.

sVEl Hijo; Horacio Quiroga
p9561
VGénero: Prosa ficción \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Realismo/Naturalismo\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aQuiroga vivió en la provincia selvática y subtropical de Misiones, una región muy aislada e indomable en el noroeste de Argentina, cuya tierra es de un colorido intenso. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDualidad: es un ejemplo de una dualidad provocada por causas psicosomáticas . El padre, en lugar de crear una nueva realidad en la que escapar, en realidad alucina , que es una condición fisiológica. La muerte del hijo sirve como estímulo exterior para desencadenar una reacción psicosomática. \u000aEl amor de un padre: el amor incondicional a su hijo y mantiene una comunicación/relación abierta con él. \u000aEstado psíquico del padre:. Sabe que su hijo ha muerto. No grita oralmente, solo en su corazón. No quiere enfrentar la realidad. \u000aTragedia: El padre evita la tragedia por el deslizamiento en un estado alucinatorio. Le da tanto terror que no puede enfrentarlo. Le da alucinaciones, y sigue adelante como si su hijo estuviera vivo. \u000aNarrador: Omnisciente, siempre al lado del protagonista, contando todos sus sentimientos, pensamientos y acciones\u000aTiempo/Espacio: Es muy lento. Se dan las horas exactas/ Es muy denso: el calor de la selva tropical se menciona con frecuencia. La intensidad paralela la intensidad del sufrimiento del padre.\u000aPrefiguración: Al principio el padre teme que algo le pasa a su hijo: "¡Tan fácilmente una criatura calcula mal y sienta un pie en el vacío, y se pierde un hijo".\u000aPropósito/Moraleja: A pesar de los esfuerzos del padre de prevenir el peligro, el hijo muere. Moraleja: la idea que las cosas pasan y uno no las puede controlar, aunque intente hacerlo.

Y es importante destacar en este poema la astucia de este gran poeta español para decirnos que EL SOL ---para mi los mas ricos,el rey---tambien ha envejecido,y que cansado y muerto de sed bebe agua en un arroyo semejando su final.No podriamos olvidar mencionar el final de los animales que se encontraban descansando en las imaginarias sombras de los arboles del monte,incapaz de poder caminar y robarle un poco de luz al sol. Sencillamente es un juego de palabras donde nos muestra desde 3 angulos diferentes el similar destino de todos los seres vivos.

sVBalada de los dos abuelos
p10053
VAutor: Nicolás Guillén\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: Este poema toma la forma de un diálogo entre el abuelo blanco y el abuelo negro del poeta. Aunque vengan de culturas diferentes, los abuelos acaban abrazándose y cantando juntos. Esa unión de las razas se manifiesta físicamente en la figura del poeta, un mulato cuya identidad viene tanto del abuelo blanco como del abuelo negro. La llegada de los europeos a las tierras del Nuevo Mundo trajo la esclavitud y mucha miseria a los no blancos, lo cual comunica el poeta a través de imágenes de llanto y sangre para caracterizar al negro. Pese a esto, el poema termina con un sentido potente de triunfo de lo bueno sobre lo malo. En los últimos versos, se elimina cada vez una acción triste (como gritar o llorar) hasta llegar a un fuerte "¡Cantan!" Para Guillén, el mestizaje es algo positivo que se debe celebrar en las sociedades pluralistas, en vez de rechazarlo con una jerarquía formal y rígida de clases y teorias racistas.

Perseus is then born and is half god and half human. Polydectes is the king of the island Perseus and Danae wash up on. Polydectes orders Perseus to kill and take the head of Medusa as an ultimatum. Perseus goes on a long journey where he crosses paths with other dangerous individuals and his journey results in him decapitating the head of Medusa. He returns home and marries Andromeda who later gave birth to the strongest man in the world, Hercules.

Angustia y vacío existencial donde se halla inmerso aquel a quien nada le resulta grato o atrayente. Siente hastío de sí mismo y no obstante le encantaría poder expresar su rebeldía contra el mundo y su disgusto -"sería delicioso asustar a un notario con un lirio cortado"-.

Therefore there's no need for complaining about our earth or ourselves as individuals. \u000aWe are meant to be the way we are.\u000a\u000aBefore God came into involvement with the world, it was once empty, dark, and desolate. Once he came into play, he started to create things that would help us all (his people) in the future. The first day, he created the terms "night" and "day", separating the dark from the light. The second day, he created a dome to separate our two bodies of water. One of which he named "sky". On the third day, he separated the wet from the dry; naming the wet the "seas" and the dry the "land". He also created plants and trees which were planted on both wet and dry. The fourth day, he created the sun, moon, and the stars in order for us to receive light and to tell day and night apart. This would also tell us about the year, days, and seasons. On the fifth day, he created all living creatures of the sea and all winged birds which he multiplied so they could fill the seas and sky. On the sixth day, he created animals to fill the earth as well as human life. On the seventh day, he had finished creating therefore rested. He was extremely satisfied with the way that he molded the earth.

sVVolveran las oscuras golondrinas; Gustavo Adolfo Becquer
p11379
VGénero: Poesía \u000aSiglo: XIX\u000aMovimiento: Romanticismo tardío \u000aContexto histórico: \u000aBécquer es el poeta lírico más melódico y exquisito del siglo XIX e influyó mucho a los poetas del Modernismo, Ecos del discurso amoroso de su poesía se escuchan hasta hoy día en la lírica hispánica. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aBécquer's famous "Volverán las oscuras golondrinas" is structured on concepts of time and space. It describes the coming of spring, with the return of the swallows and the blooming honeysuckle\u2014the perfect setting for lovers. Of course, the poem turns heartbreaking as the poem's female character turns a deaf ear to the male's sincere love. The poem could easily have been part of "La construcción del género," as it shows the ungrateful woman rejecting the sincere love of the man. \u000aForma métrica: Pie quebrado(1eros tres versos) \u2192 Once (endecasílabo) Patrón de rima: ar/an. \u000aElementos estructurales: elemento cíclico\u2192 volverán los pájaros y flores; No volverán las especiales que llamaron la atención a los amantes. Barreras: Cristales del balcón, la tapia, el sueño (la indiferencia de la mujer). El yo poético quiere saltar esas barreras (las golondrinas hacen nidos, las madreselvas escalan la tapia y el amante, con palabras y de rodillas, ruega)\u000aAliteración: produce musicalidad con los sonidos alveolares /l/, /n/, /r/, /v/ \u2192 ej. Volverán las oscuras golondrinas\u000aAnadiplosis: Varias estrofas terminan con "volverán" y las siguientes empiezan con la misma palabra \u000aSímil: Las gotas de rocío se convierten en lágrimas \u000aTiempo: pasado a futuro \u2192 El yo lírico recuerda golondrinas, madreselvas y amor e implica que volverán en el futuro; Tiempo cíclico de la naturaleza: El renacimiento de la naturaleza en la primavera. Comparación Amor = naturaleza indica que el amor puede renacer también. Pero hay que recordar que no vuelven ciertas cosas particulares y especiales: unas golondrinas, unas flores y un amor especial.

sVsymbol/symbolism -
p12175
V- Generally, anything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete--such as an object, action, character, or scene--that represents something more abstract. However, symbols and symbolism can be much more complex. One system classifies symbols in three categories: (1) Natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to represent ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge). (2) Conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scales of justice for lawyers). (3) Literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated as is the whale in Moby Dick and the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

sVEl Ahogado mas Hermoso del Mundo; Gabriel Garcia Marquez
p12349
VGénero: Narrativa- cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom-Realismo mágico\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aSe encuentra en el ámbito del Realismo mágico. Al igual que en otras historias de su (por ejemplo , "Un señor muy viejo con Unas Alas Enormes "), una figura inesperada invade el espacio de alguien y provoca una transformación. La "magia " viene del hecho de que el invasor no es una figura reconocible, y el "Realismo " es que las personas afectadas no están del todo sorprendidas por la presencia del objeto desconocido. Estas apariciones mágicas parecen representar algo, aunque\u000alo que representan nunca es explícito. Claramente , sin embargo , tienen un poder transformador. El ahogado trae un \u000anuevo entusiasmo y creatividad para el pueblo , y los residentes son por lo tanto capaces de escapar de su insularidad.\u000aNarrador: Omnisciente, objetivo. Solo describe; no interpreta. Es capaz de saber todo lo que está pensando la gente del pueblo. \u2022 No hay asombro ante los hechos poco probables y 'mágicos'. Hay un discurso indirecto libre ya que incluye las citas directamente como parte de su narración, sin separarlos con puntuación. \u000aAmbiente: Es un pueblo árido, pobre, escuálido. \u2022 Monótono, aburrido. \u2022 Forma un contraste destacado con todo lo que representa Esteban: belleza, virilidad, grandeza, nuevas posibilidades, etc.\u000aTransformación de Esteban: Después de quitarle las algas, ven que es un hombre, pero muy diferente de los hombres del pueblo. Va cobrando más y más importancia y creando cada vez más carácter mítico y de grandeza en su imaginación. \u2022 Lo personalizan; lo hacen parte de sus vidas. Puede simbolizar que los casos inesperados y milagrosos que pasan en la vida tienen la capacidad de transformarla. \u000aProtagonista colectivo: Es universal; puede referirse a cualquiera. \u000aHipérbole: La inmensidad del cadáver y todas las molestias que presenta. La hipérbole es la base del relato. Todo se exagera, y la exageración va creciendo, paso a paso, hasta terminar en su conversión en el salvador del pueblo. O sea, un hombre ahogado termina siendo un ser mítico que transforma todo un pueblo. También provoca mucho humor. \u000aSigno Indeterminado: Puede representar muchas cosas, pero nada concreto. \u000aAhogado: Da al pueblo tedioso algo diferente e interesante. El pueblo nunca será igual después del contacto con Esteban. Aunque el signo no es concreto, el efecto que produce es muy positivo.

And, no one thing is highly more superior than another. There are several things that come our way that have the same effect as others; just like the author states that taking drugs takes the place of dying because in both, one is relaxed and asleep.\u000a\u000a\u000aHoly fourteen-line sonnet from memoir Death be Not Proud by John Donne (1633)\u000a\u000aIn this poem, we learn that death is not as powerful as we make it seem. The author makes death a person and tells him that he shouldn't feel too powerful because not everyone is afraid of him. The reason why he isn't as powerful is because we don't really die, but simply move on to living in the afterlife. Death feels like he is very mighty and superior but the author tells him that there is no hierarchy stating that he is on top of everything else. The author also tells him that even though some desire death due to suffering in the earth, the rest that they receive from death can be received elsewhere therefore he isn't as strong as he feels..

The fallacy of division is the opposite or mirror image of the composition fallacy, when you assume that all or some of the parts of an item have a particular property because the item as a whole has it. Ie: people think that a large, fancy hotel must have large, fancy rooms, when the rooms could actually be quite tiny.

Tiembla y al mismo tiempo adora a Dios. La tormenta lo eleva a una unión mística con Dios. Hay un caos en la naturaleza como en sus sentimientos que se complementan con el amor a Dios. El poeta transforma toda su admiración por la naturaleza en éxtasis, gozo que lo lleva a un encuentro con Dios en medio de la tempestad. Eleva la tempestad como Dios y al poeta como ser humano en la tierra. Al fin del poema, el terror del hablante ante el huracán se convierte en la experiencia "sublime" de la presencia de Dios.

sVLa noche boca arriba; Julio Cortazar
p14333
VGénero: Prosa ( Cuento, realismo mágico) \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: El boom latinoamericano \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aLos aztecas para aplacar a los dioses, practicaban el sacrificio humano. Para ello cazaban a miembros de tribus enemigas, los traían vivos a Tenochtitlan donde los llevaban a la cima de una pirámide, les extraían el corazón y luego quemaba los órganos en ofrenda a los dioses. La lucha para conseguir seres para sacrificar se llamaba la guerra florida. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDualidad del ser /existencia: En "La noche boca arriba " se produce una bifurcación similar que en los cuentos "El sur" de Borges. El conductor de la motocicleta , en su lecho de muerte , vuelve a crear otro espacio y se imagina siendo perseguido por los indios Moteca para ser sacrificado . El juego , al final, revela que en realidad fue el moteca que estaba recreando otro espacio con avenidas , edificios altos , ambulancias, y motocicletas. La historia ha sido leída como abarcando las dos caras de la identidad de América Latina: el europeo y el indígena. Si bien un análisis histórico típico mira hacia el pasado indígena de México, en esta historia el pasado mira hacia el futuro.\u000aTiempo y espacio: \u000aDe manera similar, Cortázar , en "La noche boca arriba ", también juega con el tiempo y el espacio,\u000apero de una manera diferente. Aquí el paciente moribundo se mueve entre dos mundos : uno que nosotros los lectores como propio , y el otro es el mundo extraño de los aztecas. En el mundo moderno el protagonista está convaleciente después de una operación , y en el otro reino está siendo perseguido por los indígenas como sacrificios humano para los dioses. En ambas realidades el se enfrenta a la muerte. El ingenioso juego con el tiempo y el espacio, sin embargo, es que el mundo contemporáneo que el lector ha imaginado como el escenario de la historia es en realidad el tiempo y el espacio que está siendo imaginado por el moribundo moteca a punto de ser sacrificado . Al igual que en Borges , Cortázar representa el tiempo como un constructo inestable ligada a puntos de vista individuales\u000aSignos tiempo moderno/pasado:\u000aModerno: avenidas, autos, motos, edificios, ambulancias, hospitales, etc.; Pasado: pantano, bosque, calzada, puñal, etc. \u000a\u2022 El lector reconoce el tiempo moderno y sobrecoge porque no tiene lugar en nuestro tiempo, sino en el tiempo pasado. Nuestro presente es imaginado por el moteca desde el pasado. Como lectores siempre lo vemos desde nuestro punto de vista y nuestra realidad. Nos sorprende cuando descubrimos otra perspectiva completamente distinta a la nuestra. \u000aSinécdoque: "El hombre de blanco"= el cirujano; Metonimia: "algo que ...brillaba en la mano" =la cuchilla\u000aTropos: "Sus pies se hundían en un colchón de hojas y barro"; "Como si el cielo se encendiera en el horizonte, vio antorchas moviéndose entre las ramas"; una lámpara violeta en la pared del hospital era "como un ojo protector"; la moto es "un enorme insecto de metal"; etc. \u000aLos sentidos: Hay mucha referencia al olor, el sabor, el tacto, etc. \u2022 Con frecuencia, el olor transporta al protagonista de un mundo al otro. \u000aParalelismos mundo moderno/mundo azteca: \u000aEl camino por el paseo en moto = la calzada por la cual corre el moteca; \u000aEl grito de la mujer que causó el accidente=el grito que da el moteca cuando lo van a matar\u000aEl hombre transportado a la ambulancia en una camilla boca arriba= el moteca atado a la camilla que lo transporta al templo\u000aOlores del hospital = olor a guerra y muchos otros olores que siente en su fuga \u000aEl brazo restringido por yeso y el aparato con pesas=las sogas con las que lo atan al ser capturado \u000aEl cirujano con el cuchillo en la mano= el cuchillo de piedra sangriento que lleva el sacrificador azteca \u000aLa moto ronroneando sobre las piernas del motociclista="el insecto de metal que zumbaba bajo sus piernas"

sVLoose and Periodic Sentences
p14675
VIn The Elements of Style, William Strunk and E. B. White counsel that we should avoid "a succession of loose sentences." "This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type: those consisting of two clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative" (25). Here is part of the example the authors employ to illustrate the point:\u000a\u000a "The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music" (25).\u000a \u000aA periodic sentence, on the other hand, is one in which the most important matter arrives at the end. Strunk and White note, "The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence it gives to the main statement" (33). Here is one sentence they offer to exemplify the point:\u000a \u000a"With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourself unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful prosecution of this war" (33).

The United States poses lots of threats on other parts of America and because they have to much power, other countries cannot control them nor have any say in anything. Martí suggests a unification but isn't possible due to United States' imperialistic power. A theme in this essay relates to the prejudices other American races face and how one society under the American branch controls all the other parts.

VArrogance can truly have serious consequences. It's one to show that being in love can make people do very crazy things--just like Apollo chased Daphne. Even though Daphne was turned into a tree in the end, Apollo treated her as a sacred person. \u000a -Apollo had just killed the Python, a giant snake, and he was truly acting although he was full of himself. Apollo comes across cupid and makes fun of his archery--Cupid does not like this. Cupid decides to punish him, shooting him with a gold arrow while shooting Daphne, a nymph, with a lead arrow. In all, the gold arrow makes Apollo fall in love with Daphne, while it makes Daphne be totally grossed out by love. In the end, Daphne does not want him and her father protects her by turning her into a tree in order for Apollo to leave her alone. Apollo is very upset but continues to love Daphne--making the laurel HIS sacred tree. Apollo also decides to wear a laurel leaf crown which signifies that he has Daphne. \u000a The meaning of this story is again, arrogance can truly have serious consequences--just like Apollo's consequences.

sVparallelism --
p16243
VAlso referred to as parallel construction or parallel structure, this term comes from Greek roots meaning "beside one another." It refers to the grammatical or rhetorical framing of words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs to give structural similarity. This can involve, but is not limited to, repetition of a grammatical element such as a preposition or verbal phrase. A famous example of parallelism begins Charles Dickens's novel A Tale of Two Cities: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity . . . ." The effects of parallelism are numerous, but frequently they act as an organizing force to attract the reader's attention, add emphasis and organization, or simply provide a musical rhythm.

VA grammatical unit that contains both a subject and a verb. An independent, or main, clause expresses a complete thought and can stand alone as a sentence.

You should also become aware of making effective use of subordination in your own writing.

V"The effect of purgation or purification achieved by tragic drama, according to Aristotle's argument in his Poetics(4th century BC), Aristotle wrote that a tragedy* should succeed ""in arousing pity and fear in such a way as to accomplish a catharsis of such emotions"". There has been much dispute about his meaning, but Aristotle seems to be rejecting Plato's hostile view of poetry as an unhealthy emotional stimulant. His metaphor of emotional cleansing has been read as a solution to the puzzle of audiences' pleasure or relief in witnessing the disturbing events enacted in tragedies. Another interpretation is that it is the protagonist's guilt that is purged rather than the audience's feeling of terror. Adjective:cathartic"

VAutor: Alfonsina Storni\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La construcción del género: Machismo y feminismo\u000aResumen: El poema habla de la inequidad que existe entre hombres y mujeres en las relaciones y en el ámbito sexual. En la primera y segunda estrofa, Storni nos presenta la imagen que una mujer podía mostrar de su sexualidad en su época: cómo debía ser, qué podía y qué no podía hacer. A partir de la tercera estrofa, Storni introduce un nuevo elemento temático en su poema. Si está permitido y bien visto que el hombre sea iniciado en la actividad sexual a partir de cierta edad y que, además, tenga otros tantos hábitos culturales como, por ejemplo, fumar, salidas nocturnas, frecuentar bares, etc. ¿por qué una mujer no puede hacerlo? Recapitulando lo dicho, a partir de esta última estrofa, Storni introduce una nueva propuesta, haciendo uso de la ironía: luego de haber sugerido a los hombres que se purificaran, y fueran entonces, tan castos y puros como a ella solicitaban, muestra con seguridad que no lo serán y, por lo tanto, tampoco tendrán autoridad para juzgarla. Es decir, esta poesía representa toda la lucha feminista que Alfonsina Storni realizó en su vida, buscando cambiar los estereotipos sexuales de su época, trasgrediendo el lenguaje y las costumbres esperadas para una mujer, dejando de lado la imagen de mujer-madre asexual para mostrar a una mujer plena, tan plena como puede serlo un hombre.

VGénero: Poesía (Barroco HA) - Redondilla \u000aSiglo: XVII\u000aMovimiento: Barroco hispanoamérica (época colonial)\u000aContexto histórico:\u000a"Hombres necios que acusáis" represents the pinnacle of Latin American colonial literature. It can illustrate a number of interesting features: that by the seventeenth century, colonial Mexican culture was at a level of development capable of producing a figure of this intellectual magnitude and urbanity; (2) that strong cultural ties existed between Spain and its colonies, as Sor Juana is clearly a disciple of Spanish baroque poets such as Góngora and Quevedo; (3) that a woman was able to achieve such notoriety in Latin America in that period, for Sor Juana's greatness is not a recent discovery\u2014she was renowned in her own time! \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: Cuartetos octosílabos con rima consonante en ABBA= Redondilla \u000aAliteración: En la estrofa 14, hay una fuerte repetición de los sonidos /p/: la que peca por la paga, / o el que paga por pecar. \u000aPercepción del género: Las redondillas de Sor Juana ambos muestran claramente cómo la mujer tiene que llegar pura al matrimonio si quiere casarse y mantener su reputación. Ironía: que los hombres quieren mujeres vírgenes, pero que constantemente las están forzando y burlando. \u000aOposición binaria: Estrofa 2: bien/mal; 3: gravedad/liviandad; 5: Thais (mujer liviana)/Lucrecia (mujer fiel); 7: favor/desdén; 8: admitir/no admitir; 12: malas/buenas; etc. \u000aEl cuadro del hombre: Goloso, egoísta, inmaduro, falta de razón (según Sor Juana)\u000aVerso 53: Pagar y pecar \u2192 La prostitución. Juego semántico: Participar en la prostitución, siendo la prostituta o el cliente. \u2022 Las respuestas variarán. Aliteración bilabial muy pronunciada.

sVMending Wall by Robert Frost
p17091
VSUMMARY: A stone wall separates the speaker's property from his neighbor's. In spring, the two meet to walk the wall and jointly make repairs. The speaker sees no reason for the wall to be kept\u2014there are no cows to be contained, just apple and pine trees. He does not believe in walls for the sake of walls. The neighbor resorts to an old adage: "Good fences make good neighbors." The speaker remains unconvinced and mischievously presses the neighbor to look beyond the old-fashioned folly of such reasoning. His neighbor will not be swayed. The speaker envisions his neighbor as a holdover from a justifiably outmoded era, a living example of a dark-age mentality.

sVAtheistic Existentialism
p17171
VAfter Kierkegaard, existential thought was greatly expanded at the beginning of the 20th century by Heidegger and Jaspers (German philosophers), whose ideas in turn influenced a large number of European philosophers. An important feature of atheistic existentialism is the argument that existence precedes essence (the reverse of most traditional forms of philosophy) for it is held that man fashions his own existence and only exists by so doing, and, in that process, and by the choice of what he does or does not do, gives essence to that existence. Jean-Paul Sartre is the epitome of modern existentialism and his version, expressed through his novels, plays and philosophical writings, is the one that has caught on and been the most widely influential.

sVStrategy (or rhetorical strategy)
p17263
VThe management of language for a specific effect. The strategy or rhetorical strategy of a poem is the planned placing of elements to achieve an effect. For example, Shakespeare's sonnet 29, "When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes," spends the first nine lines describing the speaker's discontent, then three describing the happiness the thought of the loved-one brings, all in a single sentence. The effect of this contrast is to intensify the feelings of relief and joy in lines 10-12. The rhetorical strategy of most love poems is deployed to convince the loved-one to return the speaker's love. By appealing to the loved-one's sympathy ("If you don't return my love, my heart will break."), or by flattery ("How could I not love someone as beautiful as you?"), or by threat ("When you're old, you'll be sorry you refused me."), the lover attempts to persuade the loved-one to love in return.\u000a\u000aIf you don't tell me you love me now, I will die from heartache.

sVBorges y yo
p18077
VAutor: Jorge Luis Borges\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La imaginación y la creación literaria\u000aResumen: «Borges y yo» es una meditación sobre el tema de la dualidad del ser. A partir del título, los lectores estamos frente a «Borges»\u2014el «otro»\u2014y «yo», el Borges narrador. Éste detalla su destino, su comportamiento y sus idiosincrasias, siempre en contraste con el comportamiento y las idiosincrasias del «otro», del «Borges» público. Sus diferencias quedan claras, y el lector se satisface pensando que todo es lo que aparenta ser. La esencia de este hombre es doble: la imagen pública del escritor Borges refleja apenas su realidad interior. Pero el carácter fantástico del ensayo reside en su última frase, cuando todo lo dicho se pone de cabeza. Los lectores nos hemos ideado un «yo» que habla en confianza de su relación con el ausente: el «otro», el que falsea, que magnifica y adopta poses afectadas de actor.

VAutor: Antonio Machado\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La dualidad del ser y el enigma de la existencia\u000aResumen: En este poema encontramos una idea principal: el poema es un elogio a lo cotidiano, y esto quiere decir que va dirigido a la gente sencilla, que pasa desapercibida y por quienes pasa el tiempo rápidamente, sin dejar huella, hasta la muerte. Es algo extraño, ya que en el modernismo se intentaba hallar la belleza lejos de la realidad cotidiana. La principal preocupación de Machado podría ser el contraste entre gente buena y gente mala. Después encontramos diferentes ideas secundarias, además de elogiar a lo cotidiano, Machado hace una dura crítica a todos aquellos que se creen mejores que la gente sencilla por no hacer lo que ellos consideran vulgar, y que la gente normal sí hace, como ir a la taberna. Aparece el tema de la vida como camino, así como el de la muerte, muy común en los poemas de Machado.

Sueña curiosamente que es un indio mexicano de la época azteca, que esta perdido entre las ciénagas y se siente perseguido por una tribu enemiga que lo quieren sacrificar. Se despierta repetidas veces al principio aliviado pero luego confundido, las ultimas veces tratando de evitar esa pesadilla hasta que descubre que el sueño en verdad era la realidad. La segunda pesadilla se intercala con la primera por que es el supuesto sueño. Describe un episodio de la guerra florida en donde un indio azteca es perseguido por una tribu enemiga, los Motecas huye y lucha por su vida, al final es capturado, atacado y arrastrado hacia la gran pirámide. Allí un sacerdote lo espera con un puñal para sacrificarlo ya que este era un rito del esta tribu. Antes del fin el joven toma conciencia de la verdadera realidad, que su sueño, era real y que su realidad era su sueño. Alcanzo a cerrar otra vez los parpados, aunque ahora sabia que no iba a despertarse, que estaba despierto, que el sueño maravilloso había sido el otro absurdo como todos los sueños.

Odysseus was the king of Ithaca, husband of Penelope and father of Telemachus, favorite of Athena, and wiliest of the Greeks involved in the Trojan War. Odysseus earns this title by, among other things, masterminding the Trojan Horse. He is most famous for the ten years it took him to return home from the war, which is described in the Odyssey.

p20161
VJesus was accused of blasphemy by both the Jewish high priests and elders of Sanhedrin, arriving at the decision to put him to death. Jesus was taken to Pontius Pilate which was the Roman governor of Judea to agree to put Jesus to death. Pilate found him innocent, but when the Jewish priests were asked they said "Crucify him!" Before his crucifixion Jesus was stripped naked, beaten with a whip, and a crown of thorns was placed in his head. Since Jesus was unable to carry his own cross, Simone of Cyrene was forced to carry it. Jesus was led to Goloha where he would be crucified. He was fastened to the cross by nails that were driven into his wrists and ankles. It took 6 hours for Jesus to die and in those hours people passed by shouting insults at him and scoffing. Christ's body was placed in tomb where a large stone covered the entrance and soldiers guarded the tomb. Several women(including Mary and others) on a Sunday went to anoint the body of Jesus. At that moment an earthquake happened and an angel from heaven rolled back the stone. The angels informed the women that Jesus has "risen" and told them to enter the tomb to see for themselves. The angel then told the women to go tell the disciples and they did so, but Jesus made another appearance and said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." Not only did Jesus appear here but also twice when disciples were in prayer and also to the disciples that were fishing in Sea of Galilee. Overall, Jesus made 12 appearances, but this is one of them.

VJuan Manuel: Empieza "Ejemplo XXXV" con el conde Lucanor presentando un problema a Patronio y solicitando consejo para resolverlo. El conde tiene un criado que está considerando si debe casarse con una mujer que es rica pero también muy fuerte y brava. El conde pregunta al Patronio si el criado debe casarse con ella. Patronio responde con un ejemplo de una situación similar, la historia "de lo que aconteció a un mancebo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava." En otra villa había un mancebo muy bueno pero no rico que querría casarse con una mujer de estatus más alta. Nadie querría casarse con esta mujer porque ella era tan fuerte y brava. Esos característicos no eran aceptables para una mujer en la sociedad. Aun el padre de la mujer le dio advertencia de la maldad de su hija. Pero el novie tenía un plan para cambiar a la mujer y los dos se casaron. Inmediatamente después de entrar su nueva casa, el hombre mandó al perro que le trajera agua. Cuando el perro no respondió, lo mató el hombre violentamente. Dio la misma orden al gato y entonces el caballo, matando ambos después de que los dos no hicieron nada. Entonces él dio la misma orden a su esposa. Ella siguió la orden por miedo de lo que habría hecho el hombre loco si no siguiera las instrucciones. Entonces ella se convirtió en una mujer sumisa que siempre hacía lo que su esposo mandaba. Patronio sugiere que si el criado es como este hombre y sabe como controlar a su esposa, vale el matrimonio.

The irony comes from the speaker's continuing presentation of himself as stupid even as he demolishes inferior ideas others present to him.

Las historias muestran la diversidad de los Estados Unidos y sus grupos minoritarios marginados y, a menudo explotados : la difícil la vida de los trabajadores migrantes que trabajan de sol a sol , son mal pagados , y cuyos hijos deben ayudar en los campos , negándoles una educación. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl odio y el coraje del hijo mayor se debe a la muerte de sus tíos, la enfermedad de su padre, el mucho y difícil trabajo, etc. \u2022 Maldice a Dios; se queja de su mala fortuna; no entiende por qué su familia, que es tan buena, sufre tanto. \u000aLa familia: Es una familia muy unida que muestra mucho amor y cariño para con sus miembros. \u000aLa relación con Dios del hijo mayor: Es conflictiva. No cree que Dios se preocupa por ellos. No duda totalmente en su existencia. Es creyente; solo está frustrado que Dios no los ampara aunque son buena gente\u000aTítulo: El hijo dice que el único descanso para ellos es la muerte, y la madre lo confirma. También, al ser gente pobre y sin importancia, cuando mueran, nadie se dará cuenta.\u000aNarrador: Es un narrador omnisciente pero completamente objetivo. Nunca da su opinión. Lo único que sabemos es lo que aprendemos acerca de los personajes. \u000aFinal: El cuento termina con una nota de confianza y optimism quizá el amor que existe en la familia ayuda a que el hijo no pierda la esperanza.

sVSentence structure
p21133
Vwhen an essay question asks you to analyze sentence structure, look at the type of sentences the author uses. Remember that the basic sentence structures are simple, compound, and complex, and variations created with sentence combining. Also consider variation or lack of it in sentence length, any unusual devices in sentence construction, such as repetition or inverted word order, and any unusual word or phrase placement. As with all devices, be prepared to discuss the effect of the sentence structure. For example, a series of short, simple sentences or phrases can produce a feeling of speed and choppiness, which may suit the author's purpose.

VThis Great Society Program was initiated in 1964 to prepare low-income children for school. It was the foundation of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, One reason for low-income children's educational disadvantage is that they have had less exposure than other children to such educational building blocks as numbers and the alphabet. This program furnishes that exposure and allows them to begin their formal school training on a more nearly equal footing with other students. Since its inception, nearly 18 million children have participated in the program.

VGénero: Narrativa \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Generación del 98 \u000a\u000a\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGrupo de novelistas, poetas, ensayistas y filósofos españoles, activos durante y después de la Guerra de Cuba (1898), que restauraron a España a una prominencia intelectual y literaria. Les era de gran importancia definir a España como una entidad cultural e histórica.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl enigma de la existencia: San Manuel lucha con su conciencia interior de la existencia de Dios. Él se ocupa de su dilema mediante la presentación de dos personajes por separado : el exterior , obediente, sin embargo, sacerdote poco ortodoxo y , el atormentado hombre interior . La imagen , sin embargo, no es de un hombre hipócrita , pero más bien la de un ser espiritual que siente que no debería molestar a sus feligreses con su\u000aangustia personal . En cambio, se construye una realidad ideal en el que sus sujetos llevan una existencia feliz en su ignorancia. \u000aCreación literaria: Hay dos narradores: Angela, que narra lo recuerda de la vida de Manuel (ella escribe en la vejez de sus recuerdos de juventud ), y el autor explícito, Unamuno, interviene al final y\u000aHace comentarios sobre la novela ( un claro ejemplo de la narración autoconsciente). Pero aún más\u000aintrigante es el hecho de que el narrador, Angela, afirma que el arzobispo está investigando y recopilando testimonios para la canonización de Manuel . ¿Qué pasará cuando el manuscrito de Angela llegue al alcance del arzobispo ? Claramente, su testimonio arruinará la investigación y negará la santidad de don Manuel . Esto pone en tela de juicio el objetivo del narrador. \u000aConversión de agua del lago a vino: Para mantenerlo embriagado para estar feliz. \u2022 Con el opio, la gente está en un estado ebrio sin pensar en cosas contundentes. Marx lo decía como crítica de la iglesia, cuya intención, según él, era mantener a la gente ignorante y controlada. Manuel quiere mantener al pueblo ignorante, porque eso conduciría a la felicidad.\u000aLeitmotiv: montaña, lago, leyenda del pueblo sumergido en el lago- es leitmotiv porque se repite muchas veces a lo largo de la novela y sirve como un elemento estructurante. Puede significar muchas cosas: la montaña va hacia el cielo, el lago hacia abajo (el infierno), etc. \u000aCita importante: Angela dice que don Manuel y Lázaro murieron "creyendo no creer...pero sin creer creerlo" Hay aliteración en "cre", la cual crea efectos sonoros; las repeticiones de las mismas palabras es semejante a la epífora en la poesía. La ironía es que terminaron creyendo sin creer \u2014una clara paradoja.\u000aMarco temporal: No tiene marco temporal porque no hay referencias históricas. Propósito: No es una narración realista o social; es una novela de ideas. El autor implica que son asuntos eternos, no ligados a un momento histórico.

sVSegunda Carta de relacion; hernan cortes
p23567
VGénero: Literatura documental (crónica) \u000aSiglo: Época colonial (XVI)\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico: Hernán Cortés, "Segunda carta de relacion": This provides an excellent source for showing how the Spanish viewed the world and the people they had conquered. First off, Cortés sees everything from a European perspective. While he is impressed with the urban organization of Tenochtitlán, its bustling commercial life, and its hospitable people, he continues to view the "Indians" as barbarians and people without reason. What an excellent example of the "clash" of two cultures, which would eventually lead to war and decimation\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDestinatario: Al emperador Carlos V, rey de España; Propósito: Informarle del descubrimiento, describir la cultura y el paisaje y explicar su papel en la conquista. \u000a*Deja en claro que todo lo que descubre y conquista lo hace en nombre del rey. Cortés fue un renegado que desobedeció a su comandante y emprendió la conquista por su propia cuenta. Como soldado de Velásquez, este muy bien podría haber tomado responsabilidad de la conquista. \u000a*Los llama gente bárbara que no conoce a Dios y dice que son gente sin razón, a diferencia de los pueblos civilizados de Europa. La ironía es que antes había expresado su admiración por su cultura y había anotado las muchas semejanzas con el carácter de los europeos. También es un malagradecido, puesto que Moctezuma ha sido muy generoso con Cortés.

p23661
VIn the setting of this story, the Israelites were at war with the Philistines because of their long history. David was a young Israelite shepherd boy who had brothers fighting in the war. The opposing side, the Philistines, had a giant army man named Goliath on their side and challenged the Israelites to battle him. Because he was humongous, the Israelites were too scared to sacrifice one of themselves to fight, this went on for forty days. This completely changed when David decided to volunteer to fight Goliath. At first, the king and his older brothers did not want to let him even try but he convinced them that God would deliver him. When Goliath saw who the brave opponent was, he was angry because he was a little boy and he started making jokes about David. David used his slingshot to fire a stone at Goliath. The stone hit Goliath on the forehead and killed him. David was the hero of Israel and was the future king, chosen by God.

sVSam\u000a\u000aTheseus; mythical-founder king of Athens
p24081
VThis Greek/Roman mythology represents what one hero can do for the city. Theseus is a hero filled with wise knowledge and is one of the strongest heroes in mythology. His willingness to risk his life for the benefit of the people and cause violence is the creativity of humans in which they believe in chaos to resolve problems. \u000aAt the age of 16, Theseus proved his strength by lifting up a stone rock that was sent by his father. After proving to his mother; Princess Aethra his capability, he set forth to Athens to meet his father. Theseus enjoyed having adventures which makes him so unique. During his journey he killed victims by tearing them apart between two pine trees, killed Cercyon because he was making strangers wrestle, dispatching a boar, and many others. He was welcomed by all the citizens because he traveled on foot the whole journey and showed that he has the power to create a strong empire. Upon his arrival, his father Aegeus did not recognize who he was since he remarried and had more kids. Theseus was almost poisoned by his own father but proved that he was his son by showing a sword that he left him. His father realized the skills he has and was crowned king. Like in every mythological stories there is always a scary monster that eats people. Aegeus had sent King's Minos son; Androgeus on a mission to kill the Minotaur (half-bull and half-human). Sadly he was eaten and as revenge Minos told Aegeus to send tributes (7 men and 7 women) to the Minotaur. Theseus volunteered as a brave victim to kill Minotaur and would return to Athens with a white sail. His father warned Theseus that the monster had ate everyone who dared to kill him. Theseus, along with 13 others arrived at Crete; where one of the women falls in love with him and urges an architecture to keep him safe. He promises to marry her if he kills the Minotaur and so he does with his own bare hands. Returning to Athens legends say he abandoned Ariadne and others say he let her rest on an island. He forgets to rise up the white sail and his father believes he is dead so he jumps into the ocean. Theseus marries Ariadne's sister, Phaedra and they have a son together; Hippolytus. She falls in love with her own son but the son refuses to love her and she eventually kills herself and frames Hippolytus as a rapist.

p25287
VAutor: Gabriel García Márquez\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La imaginación y la creación literaria\u000aResumen: Hay un pueblo situado en una isla probablemente en el mar Caribe. Aquel pueblo falta vitalidad en todos los aspectos. No hay flores en los jardines de las casas, gris es el color predominante en todo, y el tiempo es violenta con vientos fuertes y tempestuosos. Un día, un grupo de niños están jugando en la playa del pueblo y encuentran un ahogado en la arena. Ellos juegan con el ahogado por toda la tarde (mostrando que el pueblo es aburridísimo. ¿Quién juega con cadáver en la playa?) Después, unos hombres del pueblo mueven el ahogado al pueblo y notan que él pesa mucho más que otros hombres. En el pueblo, las mujeres lo arreglan para un entierro y enteran en que el ahogado es el hombre "más hermoso del mundo". Ellas empiezan crear historias sobre él y lo describen en superlativos para casi todos sus aspectos. Cuando ellas descubren que ningún de los otros pueblos sabe quien es el ahogado, el pueblo lo adopta y las mujeres le dan el nombre "Esteban" porque "no podía tener otro nombre". Los hombres del pueblo, al primero celosos del Esteban, también cambian a quererlo. El pueblo tiene un gran entierro para Esteban y muchas personas de otros pueblos vienen para verlo. Después del entierro, el pueblo se convierte en un lugar feliz. Los habitantes siembran flores en sus jardines, pintan sus casas en colores brillantes, y el tiempo convierte en ser soleado y calmo. Cuando los barcos pasan por aquello, los marineros dicen "allá, es el pueblo de Esteban".

sVPygmalion and Galatea

VPinocchio is an allusion to Pygmalion and Galatea. Geppetto created Pinocchio the same way Pygmalion created Galatea. Pinocchio was given life by the Blue fairy while Galatea was brought to life by Aphrodite. \u000aPygmalion and Galatea represent that a person doesn't choose who to love. Galatea also symbolizes the love and appreciation we have to our own creations.\u000aPygmalion was a greek sculptor from Cyprus. Pygmalion hated women after being disgusted by some local prostitutes. Pygmalion promised himself to never waste his time with a woman. Ironically, he dedicated himself to sculpt a woman out of ivory, perhaps to correct in ivory the flaws he saw in women of flesh and bones. After he finished his masterpiece, Pygmalion saw the woman made out of ivory as perfect and as the most beautiful woman that has ever lived. Pygmalion fell in love with the woman that he sculpted. He treated the statue as a real woman by bringing her flowers, jewels, clothes, and by giving her kisses. The goddess of love, Aphrodite, notices such love and decided to turn the sculpture into a real woman. Soon Pygmalion and the once a sculpture whose name now was Galatea got married. Pygmalion and Galatea had a son named Paphos.

Juan era secretario de una biblioteca municipal, pero deseaba vivir en su estancia en el Sur que fue de los Flores. Un día, chocó con una contraventana que no estaba cerrada. Por eso, regresó a su casa pare recuperarse. Se despertó con una fiebre y pesadillas del libro Mil y una noches. Por eso, lo llevaron al sanatorio, donde estaba tan depremido, para una radiografía. Un doctor le dijo que casi se murió de una infección de sangre. Finalmente, salió del sanatorio para su estancia en el Sur. Viajó por tren, pero el tren no visitó la estación que Dahlmann necesitó. Entonces, llegó a otra estación vacía y entró un almacén para comer. Había el patrón, que parecía como un empleado del sanatorio, un gaucho viejo, y unos hombres del campo. Juan estaba leyendo Mil y una noches y comiendo cuando los hombres le echaron una bolita de miga. Primero, Dahlmann ignoraba la acción, pero luego los confrontó. El patrón intentó a prevenir la pelea, y les dijo que Dahlmann no tiene una arma. Por eso, el gaucho viejo le prestó una daga a Dahlmann. Cuando acceptó la daga, tuve que pelear y estaba tan contento porque era una manera tan romántica de morir.

p26991
Vliterally "comedy of professional players" (Italian). A genre of Italian theater that emerged at the end of the sixteenth century. Performance relied on the portrayal of stock characters\u2014some of which were derived from Roman comic types\u2014and the improvisation of action and dialogue from a basic plot outline. There are two categories of commedia characters: unmasked and masked. The unmasked roles include the young lovers (the young man described as the innamorato and the young woman described as the innamorata). The many masked roles can usually be divided into masters and servants. The masters include: the Capitano, a braggart soldier whose romantic and military exploits are often discredited, Pantalone, a middle-aged or elderly merchant fond of courting young women, and Dottore, a pedantic show-off who often played Pantalone's friend or rival. The servant characters are typically described as zanni. The most popular include: Arlecchino or Harlequin, Brighella, and Pulcinello.

He was to first find the Amazons and then bring back Hippolyta's girdle. The Amazons welcomed him in a great manner once Hercules had found them. Hercules told the Amazons that he would like to speak to Hippolyta and a few minutes later Hippolyta was at Hercules ship. Hippolyta gave her fancy belt to Hercules because she felt sorry when Hercules told her his sad story. Since, Hera was not pleased she dressed herself as an Amazon. Hera told the Amazons that Hercules had been deceived and wanted to kidnap the queen. The Amazons were furious so they quickly went to the ship of Hercules. In one version while Hercules was on his ship he saw the Amazons coming towards him so he killed Hippolyta in order to get the belt and because he thought she had betrayed him, but in another one Hippolyta was killed by the Amazons. Hercules and the Greeks fought with the Amazons and soon sailed away to give the belt to Eurystheus since he wanted it.

Vthe end of times, where evil will be defeated by Christ during his second coming, Originates from the Book of Revelation.

Armageddon is the time for the second coming of Christ will occur, as Jesus will come back in order to defeat the anti-christ, and the devil. A great war will occur. The world ruler the anit-christ is controlling the world and wreaking chaos everywhere but still answers to Satan. The third member of the unholy trinity is referred to as the " beast coming up out of the earth" (Revelation 13:11). As satan and the anti-christ are the main leaders of the world, the beast assists them by performing satanic miracles, and influencing people to worship the beast, and follow satan. As the world is controlled by Satan, the anti-christ and the beast. Working together to control man. As armies battle for a struggle of power throughout the Holy Land and attempting to sack Jerusalem. Christ appears with his army to defeat the other great armies influenced by Satan. The armies who are battling each other forget their differences and unite to battle Christ. As Christ defeats with what is quoted in the Their struggle against such an adversary, however, is useless. It is apparent that they are put to death not by ordinary military struggle, but by the word of authority proceeding out of His mouth described as "a sharp sword" (Revelation 19:15), the opposing army is put to death by one stroke after, as they take the beast, and the false prophet and thrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. Which leads to the end of satanic control. As Satan is thrown into the abyss for the entire reign of Christ for a thousand years. Then he is destined to join the beast and the false prophet in the lake of fire. (Revelation)

sVTheme: Insanity vs. Sanity
p27643
V-insanity is a very broad term with different clinical, legal, and colloquial connotations\u000a-it can be used to mean how an individual cannot learn from his or her mistakes\u000a-it can also mean that one cannot conform to society or is simply foolish\u000a-every definition of the word, however, pertains to some deficiency in one's relationship with oneself or the world\u000a-if a man cannot get along with people in the world because he does not operate by the same set of logical principles, moral precepts, or social graces that the society around him accepts, that society might consider him insane\u000a-in the world of Catch-22, however, not only are the rules of society different from those of a non-military society, they are different from tent to tent, from person to person\u000a-there seems to be no standard for logical thinking, no universal moral compass\u000a-therefore, the fact that the men often characterize each other as "crazy" is no surprise; everyone has a different set of rules, so to each man, everyone else is not following the rules\u000a-sanity serves man by making him competent to solve problems and survive in his environment by being able to interact positively in his circumstances\u000a-therefore, a man like Yossarian who fakes illness to stay in the hospital and takes wild evasive action on every mission to avoid danger is, by some standards, quite sane; he is a survivor\u000a-in this way, Doc Daneeka is correct when he declares Yossarian sane for not wanting to fly more missions\u000a-Technical definitions aside, however, the men use the word "crazy" to describe the world around them because war is unfamiliar, unnatural, and cruel\u000a-they are on some level reacting with incredulity to the fact that they must go about their daily lives dealing with death and danger\u000a-paranoia and extreme fits of anger usually mark a person who is unfit to get along in his surroundings, but calm nonchalance amidst destruction and death can be seen as disturbing or perverse behavior, too\u000a-the different ways the men find to reconcile this disparity informs their respective worldviews

VGénero: Poesía ( Alejandrino; verso blanco o suelto)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Feminismo/Postmodernismo \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: Verso blanco (o suelto)- el verso blanco tiene una métrica estructurada( alejandrino=catorce sílabas, pero sin rima. \u000aTiene gran libertad y licencia poética, ya que no tiene ningún esquema de la rima regular. A pesar de que las dos últimas estrofas tienen rima consonante , esto no influye en su carácter de verso blanco.\u000aDualidad del ser: se centra en la relación del artista con su imagen pública. Demuestra claramente la " dualidad del ser" \u000aya que la poeta Julia de Burgos se enfrenta la mujer Julia de Burgos lo que indica claramente que son personajes muy diferentes . La implicación es que la persona verdadera y honesta es la poeta ; la \u000a"Otra" es un ser social confinado y determinado por toda una serie de obligaciones sociales. \u000aDesdoblamiento: se relaciona con la proyección del yo en otro\u000aYo: la verdad, sincera, altruista, libre e independiente, manda a sí misma, pueblo, etc.; tú: la mentira, hipócrita, egoísta, atada a su marido y a la sociedad, todos la mandan, aristócrata, etc. \u000aMujer social: Hipocresía: hace lo que demanda la sociedad. La mujer social tiene que aparentar su feminidad: rizarse el pelo, pintarse, etc. Tiene que obedecer a su marido, sus padres, la religión y las fuerzas sociales. Como esposa tiene que ser sumisa y satisfacer primero a su esposo, etc Mujer poeta: Sinceridad: hace lo que es natural y justo. \u000aContraste binario: Frío/destello, atar/correr desbocado, aristocracia/pueblo, etc. \u000aTono- Moralista y profético: La poeta representa todo lo bueno y la mujer social todo lo malo. El bien triunfará sobre el mal. \u2022 La primera virtud es la humildad, y la poeta no es humilde. Todo lo contrario, se jacta de su superioridad como persona. \u000aAnáforas: ("mi voz / tu voz" [4]; "no mandas / te mandan" [24]; repetición de "mi" [30]; etc.) \u2022 27-29; 32-33 \u2022 Muchas empiezan con "tú".

p28145
Vwhen we feel justified in fighting one evil with another one.

Retributivists believe we ARE justified in punishing those guilty of unfairly harming others even though in doing so we fail to fight the original harm (someone murdered someone or stole from someone, and we put that person in jail. It doesn't counter-act the crime, but it punishes the offender). The Two Wrongs fallacy sometimes seems plausible for another reason: to counter-act hypocrisy. For example a cheating husband won't get much sympathy when he complains of his wife's infidelity or an alcoholic calling out someone for being drunk won't really work. (under Two Wrongs category)

VThis is a list of the kinds of poems that lyric poets return to most frequently. It is convenient to name a poem by its kind because you can then compare it to others of its kind. There are many others (bird poem, farm poem, etc.), but the important thing is to realize almost any poem is a repeat of a preceding genre. Thinking "what kind of lyric is this?" makes you more aware of its place in a genre tradition, and of its response to that tradition.

It is also used when an opponent is unable to find fault with an argument, yet for various reasons, the opponent disagrees with it.

VAutor: Osvaldo Dragún\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: Esta historia se trata de un hombre que se queda sin empleo y empieza a buscar un trabajo para mantener a su mujer. Busca trabajo por todos lados pero no encuentra nada. Termina aceptando un puesto de trabajo en condiciones de absoluta inhumanidad: en una fábrica lo emplean como un perro vigilante. Su trabajo consistía en actuar igual que un perro. Como sus empleadores no cumplieron con la promesa de darle un cargo en la fábrica, él dejó el empleo y trató de encontrar otro, pero no le fue posible. Otra vez aceptó ser un perro vigilante pero con un sueldo un poco más alto. El hombre se había acostumbrado tanto a actuar como un perro que empezó a creer que era uno. Su mujer, María, estaba embarazada, pero tenía miedo tener a su hijo. El hombre siguió así; ya no sabía si era hombre o era perro. Esta obra denuncia a las injusticias sociales: la deshumanización del ser humano, los sacrificios de la dignidad para sobrevivir, la degradación del individuo frente a la injusticia social y política.

p29933
VA form of logical argument that uses claims or premises.

Often a premise will carry an implied premise that present (and essential) to the argument. Do you accept the implied premise? What appears to be solid reason can manipulate you allegiances more easily than an emotional argument; therefore, be critical when you read.

p32527
VGénero: Ensayo\u000aSiglo: XIX\u000aMovimiento: Modernismo\u000aContexto histórico: \u000a*José Martí fue precursor del Modernismo en Latinoamérica.\u000a*Esta obra maestra muestra , a pesar de su dificultad, las divisiones dentro de la sociedad de América Latina - política, social y racialmente . El autor demanda que los latinoamericanos miren a su propia realidad multiétnica y no a Europa para los modelos de gobierno. Por otra parte , esta obra pertenece de lleno en el concepto organizador del imperialismo ", ya que Martí advierte de los peligros potenciales de la participación de EE.UU. en los asuntos de América Latina. \u000aHace referencia a los muchos conflictos que resultaron en Hispanoamérica a raíz de la independencia. Entre estos conflictos entre países vecinos, se destacan la Guerra de la Triple Alianza contra Paraguay y, en este caso, la Guerra del Pacífico, entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia, en que Chile le quitó a Bolivia su única salida al mar así como un territorio rico en recursos naturales.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a*Martí escribe explícitamente del efecto pernicioso del racismo en Hispanoamérica. \u000a*Martí no habla de asimilación, sino de hermandad entre los pueblos y las razas, lo cual equivale a una forma de asimilación. \u000a*Martí aspira a los valores más altos del ser humano: justicia, amor, hermandad, igualdad social, dignidad, fortaleza, etc\u000a*Martí apela en este ensayo por la creación de un gobierno y una sociedad que refleje la realidad histórica particular de la región y no de uno que sea imitación del mundo europeo, que él piensa es muy distinto. \u2022 Que en las universidades, en vez de solo aprender la historia europea, que se aprenda la historia hispanoamericana así como otras materias que puedan contribuir al desarrollo del continente. \u000a*Martí no sugiere un plan específico para resolver los problemas. Lo único concreto es que no se puede importar ideas. También confía en la bondad del hombre para resolver los problemas.\u000a*Él dice que el indio y el negro han sido ignorados por completo por los criollos y que esto no puede ser. Hay que aceptar a Hispanoamérica como un mundo muy pluralista, y sus gobiernos tienen que incluir a todos. Otra vez aconseja abandonar los modelos europeos para resolver los problemas de América. \u000a**Martí no emplea el estilo directo del ensayo si no que emplea muchos elementos de la poesía: \u000aAudiencia: A pesar de su mensaje a favor del hombre natural, este ensayo es muy cosmopolita, como la mayoría de las obras modernistas, en el sentido de que se dirige a un grupo muy selecto de personas educadas y bien informadas, capaces de entender sus códigos y tropos\u000aAliteración:"la tundan y talen las tempestades" contiene la repetición de los sonidos dentales de t/d)\u000aMetáfora: "no podemos ser el pueblo de hojas, que vive en el aire, con la copa cargada de flor, restallando o zumbando" o sea, el pueblo es un árbol.\u000aSímbolo: "los gigantes que llevan siete leguas en las botas" representan las amenazas que el pueblo ignora, quizá la potencia de los Estados Unidos)\u000aPolisíndeton: o/o/ e y/y en la primera oración; símil: "una idea enérgica, flamea . . . como la bandera mística del juicio final". \u000aTropos y perifrasis: \u000a'El aldeano': los hispanoamericanos que no conocen más que su propio mundillo y se creen el dueño de él \u000a'Los que enseñan los puños': los que quieren luchar para quitarle territorio a sus vecinos \u000aLos 'sietemesinos': hombres inmaduros, impacientes y egoístas que lo quieren todo rápidamente sin llegar a los nueve meses para un nacimiento normal \u000a'La pelea del libro con el cirial': la lucha entre la razón y las creencias religiosas \u000a'Hombre natural': El natural es el hombre puro que vive, labora, produce, goza, sufre y muere. El otro es el falso, que por tener una educación se siente superior sin producir nada beneficioso. \u000a e l 'tigre': los Estados Unidos \u000a'Las charretas y togas', 'alpargatas' y 'vinchas': la diferencia entre lo importado de Europa y lo autóctono; prendas de lujo en contraste con prendas de trabajo\u000aEl 'vecino formidable': los Estados Unidos \u000aEl 'pueblo rubio': los Estados Unidos

sV****Metrical Variations
p32599
VIf a poem rigidly adheres to a metrical pattern, much of its charm is often lost in the monotonous recurrence of the same rhythm. Poets vary the meter in different ways. They will use one foot (spondee or pyrrhic) that is different from the prevailing one.They will use a truncated or catalectic foot - - one in which a pause is substituted for an unaccented syllable."Break/break/break..."\u000a1. They will use one foot (spondee or pyrrhic) that is different from the prevailing one.\u000a2. They will use a truncated or catalectic foot\u2014one in which a pause is substituted for an unaccented syllable. (break, break, break)\u000a3. They will use a feminine ending, in which two consecutive syllables of the rhyming words correspond with the accent on the first syllable: flying/dying \u000a4. They will use the caesura (also cesura), which is a "sense" pause in a line that does not affect the metrical count or timing. It is marked with double vertical lines (//). This method of variation is frequently found in blank verse. It is conducive to the run-on line as opposed to the end-stopped line. ("With loss of Eden, /till the greater Man (run-on) restore us./ and regain the blissful seat." (end-stopped)

VTo be "sold down the river" means the person is of no use any more or isn't wanted. There is a betrayal between the person being "sold" and the person who did the selling. The betrayal is done by someone who is often trusted by the person who was betrayed. \u000aEarliest source found: The Ohio Repository, May 1837\u000aUsed in the South when landowners would sell their servants.\u000aDuring the time of slavery, wealthy southern landowners would would sell their servants to be slaves to other plantation owners. The servants would be "sold down the river" more specifically down the Mississippi River. Being a servant then downgrading to a slave is was the ultimate form of betrayal between the landowner and their servant. The life of a servant was slightly better than that of a slave and most of the time men were the ones being sold. Not only were the servants going to be separated from their families but they were being sent to their "death sentence" since in plantations all they would do if hard labor.

sVMire los muros de la patria mia; Francisco Quevedo
p33653
VGénero: Poesía del Siglo de Oro - Soneto \u000aSiglo: XVII \u000aMovimiento: Barroco - Conceptismo \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aQuevedo's "Miré los muros de la patria mía" also deals with the passage of time and its destructive effects, but with a much more serious topic: the declining power of Spain. The seventeenth century saw Spain's power within Europe decline dramatically, and while its arts flourished like never before, the signs of social and moral decay were evidenced everywhere. And Quevedo depicts that decadence and decay in the Baroque subtext of his famous sonnet. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE.\u000aEstado de la patria: Desmoronadas (arruinadas). \u2022 Decadencia, fin de su potencia. \u000aHipérbatos (2nda estrofa): Impresión negativa: el sequío, ganados sin orden y bramando (¿símbolo de un pueblo insatisfecho?), oscuridad, etc. \u000aTema: Memento mori (recuerdo de que todo termina en la muerte). \u000aMovt. del espacio: Miré, salí, entré, sentí. \u000aEspacio público(nación) a privado \u2192 entra en su propia casa. \u000aSimbolismo: La espada vencida es otro símbolo de la decadencia de España. \u000aDiscurso religioso: "báculo , más corvo y menos fuerte" --> Un pueblo que ha perdido su fe. Posiblemente la defensa y diseminación de la religión católica había sido el motivo principal de la política exterior e interior de España, pero ahora se ha perdido ese ahínco\u000aGradación: This term is not used in English. It refers to a series of words that are placed intentionally in the order of a musical scale, either up or down. The Góngora poem ends in a famous example of gradación descendente: "en tierra, en humo, en polvo, en sombra, en nada." \u000aRetruécano: This refers to a play on words. Some of these can be very simple, but in Baroque poetry they can, as expected, be highly complex. A good example is Quevedo's use of the adjective "desmoronados" in the second line of his sonnet. He is obviously referring to the crumbling fortifications of his patria\u2014a fitting symbol of the decline of Spanish military power. However, those fortifications were originally built to protect the villages from Moorish attacks. Thus, they have a relationship to the Reconquista, which attempted to rid the country of Moors. The neologism desmoronar (to "unmoor" the country) is masterful. \u000aPolisíndeton: The example above under gradación is also an example of polysyndeton, where words\u2014usually prepositions or articles\u2014are repeated unnecessarily for aural effect. Góngora could just as easily have said "en tierra, humo, polvo y nada."\u000aQuevedo usa el estilo Barroco en "Miré los muros de la patria mía" no para jugar con un tema latino como el carpe diem, sino para expresar la decadencia militar de España

sVmorality plays
p33655
Va secular form of medieval drama that was popular between 1400 and 1550, predominantly in England and France.

VSamson went into Gaza one day and decided to spend the night with a prostitute, and when the people heard this, they surrounded the place and planned to capture him and kill him at dawn. But to their surprise, he only stayed their till the middle of the night. He tore the doors to the city gate and carried them to the top of a hill. Later on at the Valley of Sorek, he falls in love with a woman named Delilah. The ruler of the Philistines became aware of this and told Delilah if she can lure him into telling her the secret behind his strength and in return she would receive eleven hundred shekels of silver. Delilah asked Samson what is the secret of his strength and how can he come week, he responded that if he is tied with seven fresh bowstrings he would become weak. She did so and screamed, "The Philistines are upon you!" But he broke loose, and after two more fails he told her the truth. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said "because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man." Delilah told the ruler of the Philistines his secret who then shaved off the seven braids of his hair. They gouged his eyes, and took him to prison. His brothers and family went down to get him and buried him in his father's tomb, Manoah.\u000a\u000aSamson's hair represents spiritual power that grows from the conscious, while Delilah represents thoughts and emotions. Although emotions play a big part in our process of making a decision, we should not let our emotions rule our decision because those emotions get the best of us which leads us to making the wrong decisions instead of listening to our conscious and what is right

Signifying that his family is more important than money. \u000a\u000aThe meaning of this story is that money is not happiness. No matter how much of it you have, it will never be worth more than your loved ones and other values.\u000a\u000aBeing greedy leads to consequences that one doesn't realize can happen.\u000a\u000aIt tells us that being a caring, compassionate person usually gets one farther in life.\u000a\u000aOne day, Silenus, a drunken half human half goat, was found sleeping in King Midas' garden. King Midas' guards presented him to the King who warmly welcomed him into his home. Silenus started to entertain them all with wonderful stories. Since the king committed a warm act towards this drunk man, God Dionysus granted him a wish with no exceptions to it. The king was very greedy therefore he wished for everything that he touched to turn to gold. His wish was eventually granted. His bed, food, water, and even his daughter turned into gold. He realized that he would soon turn his whole kingdom into gold so he had to retract the wish as soon as he could. Because of his previous good acts, Dionysus actually did retract the wish. After this, King Midas was poorer than he had ever been before, however he realized that being poor was much better than not having his daughter. He changed his ways and became a compassionate man who would never again take his family in return for his greed. After becoming this different person he lived on an incredible life that cared about what was truly valuable.

VGénero: Prosa - Cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom Latinoamericano\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aVarias generaciones de la familia de Borges eran militares. Borges, sin embargo, era un intelectual en vez de un hombre de acción. Trabajo como bibliotecario, y él cuenta que un día se golpeó la cabeza con el marco de una ventana recién pintada y que sufrió un a septicemia que casi lo llevó a la muerte. Fue a raíz de este percance que Borges empezó a escribir relatos. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTiempo y espacio: Antes del siglo XX , el tiempo era sobre todo lineal , pero con los avances de la ciencia ( la relatividad , en particular ) y la psicología , se hizo evidente que había muchas formas de tiempo , uno de ellos el tiempo psicológico . Mientras nosotros podemos pensar que vivimos en el tiempo cronológico , estamos constantemente viajando de ida y vuelta con nuestros recuerdos y nuestros sueños y aspiraciones . Un segundo en tiempo real , cronológico puede ser un corto período de tiempo , mientras que en la mente , toda una vida puede ser condensada en espacio corto . Esto es lo que ocurre con Dahlamnn ; lo más probable es que muere en la Mesa de operaciones , pero en el corto segundos antes de su muerte , se imagina otra muerte - uno\u000amás romántico y Argentina , a pesar de su aburrido trabajo de biblioteca y su herencia germánica. \u000aEn Borges el espacio y el tiempo se funden. El mundo urbano de Buenos Aires se convierte en la pampa argentina. El tiempo linear de la enfermedad se convierte en tiempo psicológico. No se distingue fácilmente entre un tiempo y otro, o entre un espacio real (Buenos Aires) y otro imaginario (la pampa argentina). \u000aSanatorio: Se dio con la punta de una ventana abierta recién pintada y le dio una septicemia y lo llevan a un sanatorio. Sensaciones extrañas: Todo sabe mal; por la fiebre ve los dibujos de Las mil y una noches en sus sueños; cree que está en el infierno; lo llevan a otro sanatorio para hacerle una radiografía, pero lo que siente es un pinchazo para la anestesia; etc. \u000aDahlmann en su viaje al sur: Se siente desdoblado \u2014como una persona que viaja y otra estancada en el sanatorio; el tren para en medio del campo donde no hay nada y tiene que caminar diez o doce cuadras para conseguir un carro; etc. \u2022 Unos chicos se burlan de él, tirándole miguitas de pan en el almacén. El dueño lo reconoce y un gaucho viejo le tira una navaja. El protagonista tiene que pelear porque es cuestión de reputación y honor. Siente que va a morir, pero es una muerte preferida a la de la septicemia. \u000aNarrador: Omnisciente. \u2022 Parece que la acción ocurre en la mente de Dahlmann, con algún orden cronológico pero no en el tiempo o espacio normal.\u000aClimax: Se dice que elige una muerte romántica, que es exactamente lo que pasa. El lector no se da cuenta en ese momento. La atención del lector va en busca de detalles que no tienen que ver con la acción, ya que sabe el clímax. \u000aEspacio psíquico & físico: Las cosas que ve desde el tren parecen "sueños de la llanura". El vagón en que viaja no es el mismo que tomó en Buenos Aires, etc. \u2022 "Viajaba al pasado y no sólo al sur". Aquí mezcla tiempo y espacio. Los dos se esfuminan en uno solo. \u000aEspacios temporales binarios: Las dos descendencias opuestas; la metrópoli y el campo; la muerte en el sanatorio y la muerte en una pelea de navajas; etc. \u000aMuerte: Hay varias posibilidades: cuando se hizo daño con la ventana pintada; en la cama cuando todo le sabe atroz; cuando lo mandan para una radiografía; cuando le pinchan para anestesiarlo; cuando le dan la baja del sanatorio; etc. No se puede estar totalmente seguro. \u000aInferencia:El propósito de Borges es precisamente confrontar al lector con dilemas complejas de tiempos y espacios \u000apara involucrarlo en la lectura. \u000aDos planos temporales: Uno, a raíz del accidente y dos, en un mini segundo de su mente cuando se imagina una muerte romántica. \u000aTiempo:Circular: Dahlmann vuelve a la estancia de su familia; futuro: el cuento prefigura su muerte, anunciando así un hecho futuro, y al final sale a la llanura pero no se dice que muere; pasado: viaja desde el centro de Buenos Aires a los barrios antiguos y desde allí al mundo gauchesco aún más antiguo

sVstyle -
p35269
V- The consideration of style has two purposes: (1) An evaluation of the sum of the choices an author makes in blending diction, syntax, figurative language, and other literary devices. Some authors' styles are so idiosyncratic that we can quickly recognize works by the same author (or a writer emulating that author's style). Compare, for example, Jonathan Swift to George Orwell or William Faulkner to Ernest Hemingway. We can analyze and describe an author's personal style and make judgments on how appropriate it is to the author's purpose. Styles can be called flowery, explicit, succinct, rambling, bombastic, commonplace, incisive, or laconic, to name only a few examples. (2) Classification of authors to a group and comparison of an author to similar authors. By means of such classification and comparison, we can see how an author's style reflects and helps to define a historical period, such as the Renaissance or the Victorian period, or a literary movement, such as the romantic, transcendental or realist movement.

VGénero: Novela picaresca (novela realista)\u000aSiglo: XVI\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico:\u000a*Una vez más, el Lazarillo nos ofrece un ejemplo ideal. La hipocresía y la corrupción que Lazarillo descubre en la España del siglo XVI directamente influye su comportamiento y sus relaciones interpersonales. No es que Lázaro también abrace la hipocresía y la corrupción, sino que se retira de la sociedad y se hace un recluso a quien no le importa nada o nadie\u000a*Lazarillo a lo mejor fue escrito por un judío converso que se sentía marginado en la España de su época y había abrazado los cambios de la Reforma: la corrupción del clero y la hipocresía de las bulas eran temas de crítica de los protestantes. También quería pintar un cuadro\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aRelaciones interpersonales: Lazarillo is replete with examples. But let's focus on three. (1) Lazarillo's mother and Zaide form a warm and supporting relationship. However, because it's illicit by the moral and racial norms of the period, it is forced to break up. This provides an interesting example of how moral codes and systems of power affect and control human relationships. (2) Lazarillo's relationship to the escudero in the third chapter clearly illustrates the young boy's capacity for compassion for an individual who is the victim of the ridiculous honor codes of Golden Age Spain. (3) The relationship of Lazarillo to his unfaithful wife demonstrates how some relationships are based on financial need, and this need takes front seat to moral concerns. \u000aTransformación de Lazarillo: En el Lazarillo, vemos al niño madurarse. Por medio de su contacto con sus amos, se da cuenta que en el mundo las apariencias engañan: los curas no son buenos y los ricos son pobres. Ve también la decadencia moral. Por eso, al final, no le importa ser cornudo. Lo único que importa es su propio bienestar. \u000aSociedades en contacto: Lazarillo narra su historia a "vuestra merced", una persona de rango social muy superior al suyo. La novela claramente revela la diversidad de la España imperial: Lazarillo es hijo de moro y cristiana; la madre se amanceba con un negro y su hermanastro es mulato, etc. La novela es una mina de discursos sobre la raza. \u000aCreación literaria: Lázaro cuenta la historia de su vida a un tal "vuestra merced". Nosotros, los lectores, no somos los destinatarios del mensaje; solo escuchamos a hurtadillas. La narratología llama "narratario" al personaje a quien se dirige el narrador \u2014un concepto crítico muy moderno. Como toda narración en primera persona, el lector se da cuenta de que es un relato sumamente subjetivo, puesto que el narrador nos pinta la realidad desde su perspectiva y no hay la posibilidad de ver otro punto de vista. También, de esta manera, nos puede contar lo que él quiera. Esto se observa muy patentemente al final del cuarto tratado, cuando Lazarillo escribe: "por otras cosillas que no digo". ¿Qué puede haber pasado con el fraile que Lazarillo no puede contar a su destinatario? \u000aDualidad del ser: Lazarillo es el narrador de su novela, así como el personaje principal de ella. Visto de este modo, Lazarillo se desdobla en dos seres: uno real y otro ficticio. Pero como en "Borges y yo" el personaje y el autor se fusionan y no se puede distinguir el uno del otro. Otros personajes se ponen máscaras: el escudero aparenta ser de cierta categoría social, aunque vive en la pobreza, y los sacerdotes, que supuestamente deben ser ejemplos de moralidad, infringen las leyes morales

sVBalada de los abuelos; Nicolas Guillen
p35607
VGénero: Poesía negra ( verso libre)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: La Vanguardia hispanoamericana \u000aContexto histórico:\u000a**La presencia española en la región del Caribe arrasó la población autóctona con enfermedades, guerra, y labor forzado. Para sustituir la mano de obra desaparecida, los españoles importaron a esclavos africanos para el arduo trabajo de la cosecha de la caña de azúcar. La presencia africana dio lugar a un mestizaje entre blancos y negros. Uno de los objetivos de la Revolución Cubana de 1959 que trajo Fidel Castro al poder fue la eliminación total del racismo en Cuba. No se sabe si se ha conseguido esta intención pero Nicolás Guillén, como el poeta nacional de la Revolución, abrazó sus metas. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDualidad de la identidad: la doble herencia étnica del mundo hispánico. El tema de la raza y mezclas raciales, que caracteriza gran parte de América Latina , constituye la base de este poema . Entonces, se ajusta a los conceptos organizadores de "asimilación " y " diversidad"\u000aSignos: abuelo blanco/abuelo negro: Abuelo negro: lanza, tambor, pie desnudo, torso pétreo, selvas húmedas, gongos, buques de esclavos (velas, galeón); abuelo blanco: gorguera, armadura, ojos azules, aguaprieta de caimanes, mañanas de coco, costas vírgenes, abalorios. \u000aVoces de los abuelos: El abuelo negro dice "me muero"; El abuelo blanco dice "me canso". Uno es mucho más fuerte y desesperante. \u2022 El blanco grita, el negro calla. Uno manda porque tiene poder, el otro no tiene más remedio que obedecer. \u000a"Fuerte voz/despedazando el silencio" (verso 41-42)": la voz de los negreros. \u000aLos dos abuelos (en común): Es la ley del universo ("bajo las estrellas") que todos los hombres son iguales: sueñan, son del mismo tamaño, tienen el mismo orgullo, la misma esperanza, etc. "Abrazar" (verso 53) significa también "comprender", "contener", "incluir". \u000aVisión de esperanza: Los dos se abrazan; el poema termina con "cantan", lo cual simboliza la armonía.\u000aForma métrica: Verso octosílabo; patrón de rima: Asonancia en e/o, pero hay varios patrones. \u000aVerso libre: No tiene un número fijo de sílabas ni una rima fija. Sin embargo, la mayoría es octosílaba, de modo que se acerca al verso blanco. \u000aSimbolismos: "escoltar" Es un verbo más fuerte; implica protección, seguridad, así como honrar al que se lleva. Signos de la Conquista: Gorguera y la armadura guerrera. \u2022 Los galeones ardiendo en oro, las costas vírgenes, etc. "Abalorio"- abuelo blanco (verso 26): Es algo de poco valor. Los españoles vinieron para enriquecerse con el oro, pero muchos no lograron su sueño. \u000aEl abuelo negro : (verso 38) Los latigazos sangran; los ojos, como las venas, están entreabiertos por el cansancio. \u2022 Llora y sangra porque sufre. Tiene los ojos pegados porque no puede descansar; siempre tiene que trabajar. \u2022 La Madrugada (verso 39) - algo positivo, el comienzo de un nuevo día. Para el negro no hay la posibilidad de un nuevo día, y por eso se subvierte la imagen positiva en negativa\u000a"Atardeceres de ingenio"- Los esclavos, después de cortar caña todo el día, por la noche lo procesaban en el ingenio. O sea, Guillén crea una bella yuxtaposición entre "madrugada" y "atardecer", ambos con significantes aflictivos. El esclavo no tiene descanso.\u000aGradación poética: Es como el final de una sinfonía que, en vez de llegar a un crescendo, se va disminuyendo el sonido. \u2022 Da a entender que en Cuba hay (o habrá) una armonía entre las razas por medio del mestizaje. \u000aFiguras retóricas auditivas: \u000aAliteración: "gordos gongos sordos"\u000aEufonía: "bajo las estrellas altas"\u000aAnáfora: "Qué de barcos" \u000aAnadiplosis: "cantan / cantan".

sVTheme: Power of Bureaucracy/Big Institutions, Rankings
p35765
V-the lives and deaths of the men in Yossarian's squadron are governed not by their own decisions concerning dangerous risks but by the decisions of an impersonal, frightening bureaucracy\u000a-the men must risk their lives even when they know that their missions are useless, as when they are forced to keep flying combat missions late in the novel after they learn that the Allies have essentially won the war\u000a-the bureaucrats are absolutely deaf to any attempts that the men make to reason with them logically; they defy logic at every turn\u000a-for example, Major Major will see people in his office only when he is not there\u000a-another example, Doc Daneeka won't ground Yossarian for insanity because Yossarian's desire to be grounded reveals that he must be sane\u000a-several scenes of interrogation add to the bureaucracy's frustrating refusal to listen to reason \u000a-in one such scene, Scheisskopf interrogates Clevinger but will not let Clevinger state his innocence because he is too busy correcting Clevinger's way of speaking\u000a-in another such scene, the chaplain is taken into a cellar and accused of a crime, but the men interrogating him do not know what the crime is - they hope to find out by interrogating him\u000a-in these and other instances, Yossarian's companions learn that what they do and say has very little effect on what happens to them\u000a-all they can do is learn to navigate their way through the bureaucracy, using its illogical rules to their own advantage whenever possible\u000a-the ranking in this book is taken very seriously, because if you are ranked higher than somebody else, you are their superior and they are forced to listen to you\u000a-this can be seen with how when General Peckem finally gained control, but as soon as Scheisskopf got a higher rank, he lost all power and authority\u000a-Major Major, another example, outranks Scheisskopf and the latter is very confused about to act towards him\u000a-however, some characters in the novel figured out that the officers only have ranks and powers with their uniforms on\u000a-to represent this, Dunbar, Dobbs, and Hungry Joe threw the officer's uniforms out of the window and this got rid of rank symbolically\u000a-demonstrates that humans don't have rank without them\u000a-Heller goes to great lengths to point out the incompetence, pettiness, and corruption within the bureaucratic ranks\u000a-its officers are often blindly selfish, heartless, indecisive, deeply insecure, and wildly ambitious\u000a-they have no compassion for human life or any sort of morality\u000a-they answer only to those with more money and more power\u000a-accountability is often in question\u000a-the bureaucrats have no problem cutting corrupt deals with troublesome individuals to get rid of them, or sometimes just discreetly eliminating them\u000a-According to Heller, such a bureaucracy is the product of a modern capitalistic society

VAutor: José Martí\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XIX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: Con la publicación de este ensayo Martí pretendió despertar la conciencia de sus paisanos a la supremacía del imperio estadounidense y la cultura europeizante de las ciudades, la cual suprimía la cultura autóctona del campo. El objetivo fundamental del ensayo es presentar un análisis crítico de la situación de Cuba y formular una serie de propuestas para el cambio social. Para Martí, uno de los problemas principales en la actitud cubana con respecto a la independencia era la falta de confianza en su patria. Lamentando la falte de fe que se encontraba entre muchos cubanos, Martí sostiene que la única manera de luchar contra las amenazas de la corona española y del imperialismo norteamericano es desarrollar una identidad nacional propia basada en la cultura autóctona de su país.

It was their mother Gaia who persuaded them to attack their father and overthrow him; for she grieved at the destruction of her children, the CYCLOPES and the HECATONCHEIRES, who had been cast into Tartarus by Uranus. The Titan Cronos then ambushed his father and castrated him with a sickle, being himself appointed by the TITANS to be their sovereign. However, once in power, Cronos behaved as his father, and again shut the CYCLOPES and the HECATONCHEIRES up in Tartarus.

V________, German word meaning "look-alike" or "double walker", originally meant a ghost or shadow of a person but nowadays it simply refers to a person that is a look-alike of another person. In literature, _________ is usually shaped as a twin, shadow or a mirror image of a protagonist. It refers to a character who physically resembles the protagonist and may have the same name as well. Several types of _______ can be spotted in world literature. It may take the form of an "evil twin", not known to the actual person, who confuses people related to that original person. Besides, it may be figured as one person existing in two different places at the same time. Sometimes, a ________ is a person's past or future self. In some cases, it may simply be a person's look alike.

There are three dialectical stages of development (of a phenomenon or structure in society): a thesis, giving rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis, and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a synthesis. Ex. In Capitalism: The needs of the workers for fair pay (thesis) are in conflict with the needs of the elite owners to make a profit (antithesis), this conflict creates a resolution where the Government creates a mandatory minimum wage (synthesis), which then becomes the new thesis (dialectical structures exist in a chain).

sVEl ingenioso hidalgo don Quijote de la manche, primera parte; Miguel de Cervantes
p36569
VGénero: novela moderna\u000aSiglo:XVII\u000aMovimiento: Siglo de Oro- Barroco \u000aContexto histórico:\u000a En Don Quijote se ve un caso irónico de ayuda al individuo que resulta perjudicado. La ayuda que don Quijote le ofrece a Andrés \u2014un acto totalmente altruista\u2014 resulta en un mayor castigo para el pobre chico. Aquí se ve el desengaño profundo que se expresa en la novela y que caracteriza todo el arte Barroco. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTransformación de los protagonistas (Parte 2): Los críticos han comentado de la "sanchificación" de don Quijote y la "quijotización" de Sancho. O sea, los dos se van transformando a lo largo de la novela a causa de la influencia del uno al otro. Sancho se hace más idealista y don Quijote más realista. Esto se observa claramente en el último capítulo cuando don Quijote vuelve a la razón pero Sancho quiere volver a las andanzas caballerescas. \u000aDualidad del ser: Don Quijote is another iconic example of the displacement of the self. Alonso Quijano (or whatever his name might be, for it keeps changing) constructs an ideal world in which knights corrected wrongs and fought injustice. He transforms himself into one of those knights and sets out to change the world. The greatness of Cervantes's novel is that the real man and his fictitious creation are fused to the extent that the reader seldom knows if the protagonist's actions are real or not. This point is driven home in Chapter V, when a neighbor tries to tell don Quixote that he's actually Alonso Quijana, and don Quixote responds: "Yo sé quien soy, y sé que puedo ser no solo los que he dicho, sino todos los doce Pares de Francia." \u000aRealidad y fantasía: Don Quijote plantea en la literatura occidental una pregunta fundamental y universal: ¿Qué es la realidad? A lo largo de la obra, se le da vueltas constantes a ese dilema. Don Quijote altera la realidad para sus propias necesidades: cuando está cansado transforma una venta en castillo; cuando tiene que impresionar a Sancho transforma los molinos de viento en gigantes. Cuando su escudero le recuerda que eran molinos de viento, el caballero le da la razón, pero dice que fueron sus enemigos (los malignos encantadores) quienes transformaron los gigantes en molinos, etc. Siguiendo las ideas de Platón, las cosas están en un constante estado de cambio: una silla puede ser un trono para un rey o una escalera para alguien que necesite encaramarse. Como resultado, no es fácil fijar la realidad; todo depende del punto de mira de cada individuo y el contexto en el cual existe. \u000aMetaliteratura: \u000a El narrador dice que no importa el nombre exacto del héroe. \u2022 El autor implícito no es el único que no ha visto sobre Es autoconsciente; hay un discurso metaliterario; el autor se basa en fuentes de información \u2014don Quijote no es simplemente fruto de su creatividad.\u000aLos nombres: No se pueden identificar; se convierten en genérico. Cuando reciben nombre tienen una identidad específica. Los nombres exactos no importan. Pero más profundo es la noción de que es imposible saber lo que es la realidad exacta. La expresión "conjeturas verosímiles" es una paradoja. \u000aSociedades en contacto: En DQ se observan varias estradas sociales: labradores, prostitutas, arrieros (moriscos), mercaderes de seda (conversos), nobles (la dama camino al Nuevo Mundo), etc. \u2022 Construcción del género: Don Quijote protege a las mujeres y las trata con respeto, algo que los hombres de su época a lo mejor no hacían. Esto se ve en su trato con las prostitutas de la venta.\u000a Tiempo y espacio: Don Quijote revive otros tiempos y espacios que no son los suyos. Intenta recrear un momento idílico, aunque ficticio, en que la bondad reinaba. También, don Quijote viaja por un espacio real: Castilla, con sus ventas, molinos de viento y ciudades. \u000aRelaciones interpersonales: Aquí se destaca la íntima relación que se establece entre don Quijote y Sancho. También, hay momentos conmovedores de humanidad: el respeto que le da don Quijote a las prostitutas, la defensa a Andrés y el vecino (Pedro Alonso) que ayuda a don Quijote y lo lleva a su casa. Dualidad del ser: Claramente, don Quijote se inventa otro "ser" y vive entre ser Alonso Quijano y don Quijote. En la escena con Pedro Alonso, don Quijote dice "Sé quien soy. Y puedo ser el que quiera". O sea, sabe que hace un papel que él mismo ha elegido. \u000aCreación literaria: Aquí la novela ofrece una mina. En primer lugar, tenemos el intertexto de las novelas de caballería. Luego vemos a Alonso Quijano crearse en el personaje de don Quijote (nombrándose, eligiendo una dama, etc.) así como el autor crea un personaje ficticio. Según el autor implícito, basa su novela en documentos de los archivos de la Mancha. Cuando ya no hay más información, se descubre el manuscrito en árabe de Cide Hamete Benengeli, que el autor implícito hace traducir al castellano y de ahí basa su novela. Todo esto nos hace reflexionar sobre la creación literaria y a la misma vez pone en tela de juicio la veracidad de los textos históricos: ¿Se puede confiar en una traducción no profesional del árabe al castellano hecha por un moro?

p37263
VAutor: Juan Rulfo\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las relaciones interpersonales y sociales\u000aResumen: El padre lleva sobre sus hombros a su hijo herido, buscando el pueblo, Tonaya, que el ladrido de los perros demarca; sin embargo, el padre no puede oír los perros ladrar porque el hijo tapa sus orejas. El padre lleva al hijo cargado, tambaleándose, tropezándose por la oscuridad hasta que la luna alza y le guía al padre. El padre hace lo que hace por la difunta madre de Ignacio. Para el padre, el hijo ya no es su hijo porque ha maldecido la sangre por su delincuencia (él es un criminal: ha matado y ha robado). Ignacio solloza culpablemente antes de que llega al pueblo fallecido con su cuerpo flojo y descoyuntado.

VAutor: Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XIX\u000aTema: Tiempo y espacio: Tema y técnica\u000aResumen: En este poema, se hacen presentes todas las características del romanticismo. El enamorado recurre con desesperación, celos, tristeza y angustia al recuerdo del amor perdido; nada en el mundo es suficiente para describir su desolación. Las golondrinas, las madreselvas, las ardientes palabras de amor--todo puede renacer, excepto el amor perdido y la fatalidad que hará imposible el reencuentro. Solo le queda el hedonista consuelo de estar seguro de que nadie conseguirá amar como él ha sido capaz.

p38897
VThe novela tells the story of the local Catholic Priest (Don Manuel) in fictional Valverde de Lucerna, Spain as told through the eyes of Angela, one of the townspeople. Throughout the course of the story Manuel is adored by the people of the town. He is constantly in the service of the townspeople. He refrains from condemning anyone and goes out of his way to help those whom the people have marginalized. Instead of refusing to allow the holy burial of someone who committed suicide, don Manuel explains that he is sure that in the last moment, the person would have repented for their sin. Also, instead of excommunicating a woman who had an illegitimate child, as the Catholic Church would have done, don Manuel arranges a marriage between the woman and her ex-boyfriend, so that order will return to the town, and the child will have a father figure. The people of the town consider him their "Saint" because of all of the good deeds he does.\u000a\u000aAngela, after a brief stint away for education, returns to the town to live with her mother where she continues to be amazed at Manuel's devotion.\u000a\u000aLater, Lazarus, Angela's brother returns from the New World, disgusted with the mental and physical poverty he finds in the town. He too is amazed at Manuel's devotion but believes that "He is too intelligent to believe everything he teaches." It is clear that Lazarus does not have a sense of faith. Angela's and Lazarus's mother passes away. On her death bed she makes Lazarus promise to pray for her\u2014he swears he will. Her dying wish is that Manuel can convert him. Lazarus begins following don Manuel "to the lake" where Manuel is known to walk and think. Time passes and Lazarus takes Communion\u2014to the townspeople, he appears to be converted. In reality, Lazarus is only praying for his mother's sake because it was her wish, not because he has faith.\u000a\u000aImmediately following the Communion, Lazarus sits down with Angela and tells her that he has something he must tell her: Both Manuel and Lazarus have no faith in God, specifically no belief in an after-life. Angela is upset and incredulous but confronts Manuel about what Lazarus has said. In their conversation it becomes obvious that what Lazarus has said is accurate. Manuel believes that religion and the preaching of religion is the only way for the people to live contentedly\u2014Lazarus through their talks had come to admire Manuel's determination to do what he thought was right despite his lack of belief in the veracity of what he taught. To that end, Lazarus felt it best to continue in the same way by returning to the fold. Although Angela questions the goodness of such a deed, Lazarus insists that don Manuel is a saint for the things he has done all his life for the town.\u000a\u000aManuel grows increasingly weak. He is unable to bear the weight of teaching the resurrection when he does not believe it is real. He falls further and further into a depression, the towns people see this as a reflection of Christ in their local priest. When Manuel dies he chooses to do so in public in the center of the town, and the people see him as their "second Christ." Lazarus takes on Manuel's role until his own death. Angela moves out of town. She finishes her narration by explaining that Manuel is being considered for beatification and that he is being held up as the ideal and exemplar priest.

Eso ya no me importa. con tal que se vaya lejos, donde ya no vuelva a saber de usted. con tal de eso porque para mi usted, ya no es mi hijo. he maldecido la sangre que usted tiene de mi. La parte que a mi me tocaba la he maldecido., He dicho : ! que se le pudra en los riñones la sangre que le di!, lo dije desde que supe que usted andaba trajinando por los caminos, viviendo del robo y matando gente... y gente buena". El hecho de querer salvar al hijo es sólo el cumplimiento del deber por parte del padre, el hijo no recibe palabras de alivio ni de consuelo o solidaridad, el padre no siente pena por el hijo moribundo, siente la desesperación de quien ha perdido la esperanza de recobrar al hijo amado. El padre de Ignacio cumple con la obligación que siente hacia quien fue su mujer y así se lo dice al hijo. se percibe el dolor del padre de ese hijo delincuente que pronuncia las palabras llevado por el dolor y la rabia. No Oyes ladrar los perros, cuento realista de Rulfo que nos presenta al hijo que necesita del amor y apoyo del padre pero tambien al padre que ha llegado al límite de la desesperanza y la inminente muerte del hijo lo conduele.

VAutor: Miguel de Unamuno\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La dualidad del ser y el enigma de la existencia\u000aResumen: Ángela Carbanillo es una joven de Lucerna de Valverde, que hasta que cumplió los quince años estudió en un colegio de monjas pagado por su hermano, Lázaro. Cuando dejó de estudiar volvió a su pueblo, donde se encuentra con sus amigos, familiares, vecinos y con un personaje muy conocido, el párroco Don Manuel. Cuando Ángela cumple veinticuatro años, su hermano Lázaro vuelve al pueblo para llevarse a ella y a su madre a la ciudad pero no las convence y decide quedarse. Con el transcurso del tiempo se crean controversias entre Lázaro y Don Manuel pero al demostrarse una gran amistad, estas casi desaparecen, aunque siguen manteniéndose algunas diferencias ya que Lázaro sabe, y a su vez Ángela sospecha, el secreto de Don Manuel. Antes de morir, Don Manuel le dice a Lázaro que su mayor deseo es que la gente tenga fe y, así, mantenga su esperanza; a pesar de que el no la tenga. Le dice que no se lo cuente a nadie porque rompería con las esperanzas de todo el pueblo y para Don Manuel, era tan importante creer en la vida como creer que hay algo después de la muerte. Pide que le lleven a la iglesia para realizar su última misa y poder despedirse de su pueblo. Tras su muerte, Lázaro lo va a visitar todos los días a su tumba. Lázaro en una conversación con su hermana le dice que él no puede creer en Dios, como Don Manuel, porque no tiene pruebas de su existencia. Ángela, después la muerte de su hermano, decide escribir todo lo que sabe, aunque ella lo escribe esperando que nadie lo lea y descubra el secreto de Don Manuel.

sVLa Casa de Bernarda Alba; Federico Garcia Lorca
p39371
VGénero: Teatro (drama moderno)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardia\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aCostumbres tradicionales en unos pueblos de España e Hispanoamérica es que la familia debe guardar el luto durante 7 años después de la muerte de un familiar cercano. Durante este periodo, todos se visten de negro. La hija mayor debe casarse antes de que puedan casarse las más jóvenes. Los novios se cortejan desde los balcones, cuyas rejas permiten hablar pero poco más. Las mujeres de la familia preparan el ajuar de la novia, haciendo ropa de cama y mantelería que bordan a mano. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a La continuidad de la tradición: Se debe notar que Lorca crítica esta tradición. El aborda el tema con mayor complejidad y profundidad, al ser una mujer (Bernarda Alba) la que impone \u2014de un modo intransigente\u2014 la tradición. \u000aFeminismo: Sin embargo, las viejas costumbres y la moralidad todavía oprimen a las mujeres, como se ve claramente en La casa de Bernarda Alba. \u000aActo I: Las mujeres tienen que comportarse de una manera determinada por la tradición. Esto incluye la obediencia a los padres y a los esposos, el comportamiento moral, la virginidad, etc. \u000aSimbolismo: \u000aLas manchas: la limpieza que exige Bernarda forma un paralelo con la pureza que espera de sus hijas; hay que notar que las manchas no salen; \u000aEl bastón de Bernarda: su autoridad; es fálico y ella hace el papel del hombre en esta pieza;\u000aVestido verde de Adela: el color de la naturaleza \u2014ella quiere liberarse; \u000aEncierro de Josefa: no permitir que las mujeres tengan una vida propia \u2014están encerradas por la tradición. \u000aActo II: \u000aProblemática central: Pepe y Adela han entablado relaciones. \u000aSimbolismo: acto de bordar con aguja- Reproduce el acto sexual. \u2022 Representa la pasión sexual que sienten. \u2022 Un grupo de hombres jóvenes en el pueblo fascina a las hermanas; su romance es algo picante: piden rosas del pueblo, lo cual representa aquí chicas. \u000aDiscurso feminista: Adela se rebela y dice que hará cualquier cosa para estar con Pepe. Bernarda sigue su papel de autoridad, pero el público empieza a darse cuenta que algo muy grande se está urdiendo que quizá ella no pueda controlar como quiere. Pecado de Librada: Bernarda y Martirio concuerdan con los que la quieren matar, pero a Adela le da lástima y quiere que le den la libertad. \u2022 Forma parte del trasfondo de la obra: el de un pueblo tradicionalista y restringido en asuntos sexuales. Cuando los impulsos naturales se restringen tan severamente, el resultado son actos salvajes y horripilantes como este. \u000aIronía de la ignorancia de Bernarda: Poncia dice que Bernarda es capaz de saber lo que está pasando a muchas leguas de su casa, pero no sabe lo que pasa en su propia casa. Esta ceguera es un ejemplo de ironía dramática y de ciertas faltas de Bernarda (hamartia de la tragedia griega) y de arrogancia (el hubris). \u000aLas relaciones sociales e interpersonales: Si bien uno asume que debe haber los lazos de amor entre los miembros de la familia, lo que vemos es sobre todo hostilidades reprimidas y odio entre las hermanas. ¿Cuáles son las causas de esta ruptura de los vínculos tradicionales ? En parte , es la comunidad en la que viven , con sus reglas y tradiciones restrictivas , junto con el poder represivo de la madre dominante . Como resultado, el juego ilustra brillantemente cómo los factores externos operan dentro de las relaciones humanas. \u000aPersonajes: Amelia es muy inocente y amable; Martirio es una mujer angustiada y negativa que amarga los pensamientos de Amelia. Relación más conflictiva: Magdalena llama a Martirio una hipócrita. Bernarda y sus hijas: Parece que le tienen miedo; no hay respeto ni amor. \u000aBernarda Alba: la antagonista, con su reprensible sentido del poder, así como su concepto reaccionario de la honra, destruye las vidas de sus hijas. \u000aActo III: \u000aEspíritu de paz y sosiego (calm): Propósito dramático es un tipo de alivio\u000aSimbolismo: \u000aCaballo sin desbravar dando patadas en el corral: Simboliza la fuerza masculina encerrada y apartada de las mujeres; sus patadas son un recuerdo constante para las hermanas de esa pasión que se les prohíbe. \u000aLa oveja que trae la abuela: el instinto maternal; sed de contacto con hombres, del placer carnal; \u000aDestrucción del bastón de Bernarda: destruye su autoridad. \u000aMuerte de Adela: ¿ culpabilidad de Martirio? Sí, se puede llegar a esa conclusión. Martirio ama a Pepe y ya le había dicho a Adela que haría cualquier cosa por prohibir que Adela salga la victoriosa con Pepe. \u000aLa palabra SILENCIO: Empieza con "silencio". Termina con "silencio". Puede significar una estructura circular: nada cambiará en la casa y seguirá la tristeza y la frustración. \u000aSubversión del arquetipo del hombre controlador: La mujer (Bernarda) es la que controla. Lleva un bastón, el cual es un símbolo fálico.

VNecessarily, being a "Mrs. Grundy" is not a good thing. If someone were to mention to me I would feel offended because I would be known as an individual that criticizes and only cares about myself. The literary character represents in general a person who can judge anything they see. This fictional character is well-known in literature and has been mentioned in many texts such as; Charles Dicken's Hard Times, Aimee Crocker's biography, P. T. Barnum's non-fiction booklet, and more.\u000aShe is a fictional character that represents someone very critical in society. She appears in a short play called. "Speed the Plow" by Thomas Morton as a minor character. \u000a In this story she plays the role of a farmer's wife in the year of 1798. As confusing as this sounds, she doesn't come out in the play, she is only mentioned. For example, during the play one of the characters mentions to the farmer "What will Mrs. Grundy say?" Although she never appears on stage she represents someone who judges everything they see. The name comes from the word grundyism and is defined as, a prudish adherence to conventionality, especially in personal behavior.

VAutor y nacionalidad: Miguel León-Portilla, México\u000a\u000aEpoca: La colonización \u000a\u000aResúmen: La colección de Portilla relata señales y prodigos de indígenas nahuas y tlaxcaltecas andtes de 1492 (como diez años). Por ejemplo, eran testigos del ciclo delo sol y la noche que lo describieron como una maravilla. Las imágenas del fuego destruyendo sus templos, los rayos, las olas, los cometas y la llorona fueron señales que asustaron los indígenas. Moctezuma ve en el cielo hombres armados en caballo representando los dioses. Entonces, cuando vienen los españoles piensan que son sus dioses y los mexicas son percibidos como vulnerables y temerosos. El pájaro es su mensajero muestro los conquistadores españoles por el espejo era la señal mayor que algo malo iba suceder al pueblo mexica. Estos sentimientos de sufrimiento son expresados en el poema elegiaco del nahua anónimo que reconce la pérdida de su pueblo a causa de la explotación de los españoles. \u000a\u000aConexión con otros textos: Hernán Cortés <<Segunda carta de relación>> en las perspectivas de colonización de salvando almas o la explotación de seres humanos. \u000a\u000aTemas y conceptos: Las sociedades en contacto- El imperialismo, La dualidad del ser- La espiritualidad y la religión

After Aminias rejected all his suitors he went to Narcissus who rejected him as well, for he had been given a sword.

Narcissus had walked past a river and decided to drink some water: seeing his reflection in the water had caused him to be entranced with himself. Since being unable to obtain his desire he drowned in the banks. According to a myth Narcissus is still admiring himself in the underworld from the waters of Styx.

VGénero: Narrativa del siglo XIX \u000aSiglo: XIX-XX\u000aMovimiento: Realismo/Naturalismo español (costumbrismo)\u000aContexto histórico:\u000a*Nos proporciona un ejemplo de realismo y el naturalismo , el movimiento literario importante en prosa durante la segunda mitad del siglo XIX . Sería conveniente hacer una lista de todas las formas de realismo se logra en esta pieza , señalando su realidad histórica, el regionalismo gallego , y los detalles minuciosos del ambiente y acciones, incluyendo la representación de la violencia . Ningún tema es tabú para el realismo. \u000a* Las reacciones de los personajes de "Las medias rojas" están condicionadas por ciertas normas culturales; en la España tradicional, es la obligación de la hija cuidar a un padre viudo. La ira del padre se debe en parte a que la hija infringe esa ley sagrada. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes:\u000aPluralismo étnico/racial: El medio ambiente gallego recalca las diferencias étnicas en España. \u000aSigno polisémico: medias rojas: Para Ildara representan su libertad, pero el padre no aprecia esa independencia. Le niega la libertad. Él ve las medias rojas como símbolo de vanidad. \u2022 Normalmente, los hombres emigraban primero y luego traían a su familia. Ildara va sola. No tiene quien la reciba cuando llegue. Es muy probable que tenga que prostituirse. Ese podría ser el simbolismo oculto de las medias rojas. \u000aGénero: machismo/feminismo: \u000a*Ildara sueña con la búsqueda de una nueva vida y apartarse a sí misma de la brutalidad de su padre de Ildar pero sus sueños se ven frustrados . Las mujeres , en consecuencia , están siendo dominados por los hombres. \u000a*Otro ejemplo de la continuidad de la tradición de la mujer oprimida y dominada por el hombre se ve donde un padre, por sus acciones violentas, impide que su hija busque una mejor vida independiente como mujer.\u000a*El tío Clodio de "Las medias rojas" hace lo necesario por impedir la emigración de su hija al Nuevo Mundo, lo cual condena a Ildara a una vida de opresión y miseria\u000aCostumbrismo: los elementos costumbristas crean un ambiente denso. Ildara recoge la madera , hace una fogata, cocina un caldo gallego , el padre saca un cigarrillo y fuma, etc. Los códigos indican el estatus social de la familia : el " señor amo , " la tierra que el padre trabaja duro, pero de la cual no es el dueño, la necesidad de emigrar de una vida mejor , etc.\u000aCromatismo: el color rojo: La uña de ámbar del padre; el cigarrillo encendido; la lumbre del fuego; las medias rojas. \u000aDescripción poética-acto de violencia: La descripción "puntos brillantes . . . radiación de intensos coloridos sobre un negro terciopeloso" produce un contraste brusco. Suaviza en algo para el lector el acto horripilante. \u000aSigno: "sus ojos alumbrados"- hoguera: La hoguera alumbra con su lumbre; el dolor la causa ver un cielo estrellado. Los signos se transforman: el dolor también 'alumbra' sus ojos, pero con otro sentido que la palabra previa, que se refería a su alegría por un nuevo porvenir.\u000aDestinatario: reacciona ante los hechos solamente / Narrador: no interpreta, solo cuenta. Es completamente objetivo. Aunque parece que siente lástima por Ildara, a la misma vez se vislumbra una crítica cultural por abandonar al padre.

En Argentina, que tiene una población bien educada, ha sufrido también del desempleo, o sea para conseguir trabajo mucha gente tiene que tomar puestos muy inferiores a lo que merece su formación académica. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aLas divisiones socioeconómicas: Los efectos deshumanizantes de perder el trabajo debido a las condiciones económicas severas es impulsado en esta obra en un acto\u000aLos actores como narradores, cosa rara en una pieza de teatro. El teatro no tiene una voz que le explique las circunstancias al público. Los mismos personajes tienen que dar a conocer la circunstancia directamente, sin intervención alguna. La narrativa tiene la ventaja de tener un narrador que puede, si quiere, dar explicaciones. \u000aSituación económica: El protagonista está desempleado por mucho tiempo y está desesperado. Encuentra trabajo como el de un perro de guardia. \u2022 El gerente le promete que cuando haya una vacante lo colocarán pero siempre hay una razón por no colocarlo y siempre tiene que ver con el esfuerzo de las grandes empresas a producir más con menos gente. \u000aPara sobrevivir el esposo le sugiere a la esposa mudarse a un apartamento con varias otras mujeres; él le traerá la carne que le dan de comida, porque se ha acostumbrado a comerse solo el hueso.\u000aHumor: Hay muchos pero cuando el Actor 1 va a besar a su mujer y en vez la muerde.

La preocupación de los amigos por el "perro", la preocupación \u000adel marido por el bienestar de su esposa, etc. \u000aCasilla donde tiene que dormir es estrecha, apretada= doble significado de estrechez económica y apuros, conflictos. \u000aIronía: Deja el trabajo de perro de guardia, pero el único otro puesto que puede encontrar es también de perro de guardia. En el mundo del trabajo, la experiencia es lo que cuenta. \u000aTeatro de lo absurdo vs. teatro tradicional: No hay orden cronológico ni lugar fijo. La pieza puede moverse en cualquier dirección de tiempo y espacio. Ni los actores son fijos, puesto que cambian constantemente de papel. Ya se ha comentado lo del narrador.

It hasn't really ever gone away. The sensibility? Think mysterious gloomy castles perched high upon sheer cliffs. Paintings with sinister eyeballs that follow you around the room. Weird screams from the attic each night. Diaries with a final entry that trails off the page and reads something like, No, NO! IT COULDN'T BE!!

VIs used in citing facts besides statistical, literal and historical analogies. It is something through which inner thoughts are presented in a logical way before the audience for persuasion.

VThis term describes President Johnson's ambitious, multifaceted program of social and economic reforms designed to promote social equality and economic fairness for all Americans.

These programs expanded the role of the federal government in the nation's domestic policies. Whereas Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal was a response to the deepest economic crisis in U.S. history, President Johnson planned to extend the affluence that the country was enjoying in the 1960s to those citizens who traditionally had been left behind. The president's antipoverty initiative included significant programs such as Head Start, Medicare, Medicaid.

sV*Metaphysical Poetry
p40599
VUsually refers to the work of seventeenth-century poets who used similar methods and revolted against the romantic conventionalism of Elizabethan love poetry. They tended toward psychological analysis of the emotions of love and religion. They had a penchant for the unusual and shocking, used metaphysical conceits. They intended to express honestly, yet unconventionally, the poet's sense of the complexities and contradictions of life. (John Donne, George Herbert) The diction is simple as compared with that of the Elizabethan or Neo-Classic Periods, and echoes the words and cadences of common speech. The imagery is drawn from the commonplace or the remote. The form is frequently that of an argument with the poet's lover, with God, or with himself.

sVWhat a tangled web we weave
p40631
VThis symbolizes the effect that comes with the lies we come up with . It supports the idea that one can get caught up in their lies.Emphasis on the caught up referring to the web that we create with our lies. It also represents a type of domino effect of what comes with the lies.\u000aAn example of this expression being used would be in the well known show Pretty Little Liars in how the four girls are constantly creating lies and when it's time \u000afor them to say the truth; to save themselves they have already been tangled up in the false statements they had already made.\u000aAnother example of this often occurs in children. \u000aEx: \u000a"Maya did you brush your teeth?"\u000a"Yes"\u000a"Why is your toothbrush dry?"\u000a"I blowdried it."\u000a" Our blow dryer is broken"\u000aThe lies young children do say seem to get caught up and become bigger lies.\u000aThis expression came from an epic poem by Walter Scott called Marmion . In the story Lord Marmion is trying to win over a women which is already involved with someone else ; where the issues already begin. Marmion then accuses the woman's other suitor Sir Wilton of treason in order to get rid of him. Sir Wilton then leaves the country in order to escape accusations but, Marmion leaves to fight to battle then dies.Wilton is then able to return and marry the woman anyway. The lies Marmion told were for nothing in the end he did not get what he wanted. The more destructive the lie the harder it was to maintain thus creating a more complicated predicament.

sVEl conde Lucanor (De lo que aconteció a un mozo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava)
p40915
VAutor: Don Juan Manuel\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XIV\u000aTema: La construcción del género: Machismo y feminismo\u000aResumen: La historia empieza con el conde Lucanor presentando un problema a Patronio y solicitando consejo para resolverlo. El conde tiene un criado que está considerando si debe casarse con una mujer que es rica pero también muy fuerte y brava. El conde pregunta al Patronio si el criado debe casarse con ella. Patronio responde con un ejemplo de una situación similar, la historia "de lo que aconteció a un mancebo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava." En otra villa había un mancebo muy bueno pero no rico que querría casarse con una mujer de estatus más alta. Nadie querría casarse con esta mujer porque ella era tan fuerte y brava. Esos característicos no eran aceptables para una mujer en la sociedad. Aun el padre de la mujer le dio advertencia de la maldad de su hija. Pero el novie tenía un plan para cambiar a la mujer y los dos se casaron. Inmediatamente después de entrar su nueva casa, el hombre mandó al perro que le trajera agua. Cuando el perro no respondió, lo mató el hombre violentamente. Dio la misma orden al gato y entonces el caballo, matando ambos después de que los dos no hicieron nada. Entonces él dio la misma orden a su esposa. Ella siguió la orden por miedo de lo que habría hecho el hombre loco si no siguiera las instrucciones. Entonces ella se convirtió en una mujer sumisa que siempre hacía lo que su esposo mandaba. Patronio sugiere que si el criado es como este hombre y sabe como controlar a su esposa, vale el matrimonio.

VDemeter is the goddess of agriculture and fruitfulness (fertility): guardian of marriage. Persephone is her daughter whom Hades marries and takes to Hades to live. Demeter is so unhappy without her beloved daughter that nothing can grow. A compromise is reached and Persephone spends six months on Earth with Demeter and six months below, with Hades. This is the explanation for why we have seasons (winter is when Persephone is gone and Demeter is too unhappy to make things grow).

sVPrendimiento de Antonito el Camborio en el camino de Sevilla; Federico Garcia Lorca
p41381
VGénero: Poesía (Romance)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardismo español \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aAquí vemos otro grupo marginado en la sociedad española : los gitanos. Muchas de las imágenes icónicas de España, como la del flamenco, tienen raíces gitanas, y los españoles admiran folclore gitano ; sin embargo, detestan la raza gitana por su falta de voluntad para asimilarse . Otro punto es estereotipos. Antoñito no es un gitano típico, pero sufre las mismas consecuencias como si él fuera. Para hacer el tema aún más complejo, la policía lo critica por no ser como los demás gitanos, que hubiera sacado sus cuchillos y se hubiera defendido. Es un caso de " maldito si lo haces, condenado si no lo haces.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: Es un romance; versos de 8 sílabas; asonancia en o/o en versos pares. \u000aCarácter dramático: No se dan detalles. ¿Por qué prenden a Antonio? ¿Por qué sospechan que no es gitano legítimo? El oidor tiene que intuir. Hay diálogo, lo cual contribuye a su aspecto dramático.\u000aImagenes hípicas (equestrian): La vara puede ser para espolear al caballo. \u2022 El ritmo de los primeros versos; la vara de mimbre puede ser para espolear al caballo; la brisa es "ecuestre".\u000aLa vara de mimbre: puede representar su hombría. Nota que cuando lo llevan preso no lleva su vara. \u000aSignos implícitos: Limones/Vara de mimbre- Los gitanos tienen mala fama de ladrones, pero Antoñito solo toma limones. Estos signos son muchos elementos de vanguardia no como un romance tradicional. \u000aPerífrasis: "Lo llevó codo a codo"- efecto de fuerza\u000aSinécdoque: "Los cinco tricornios"- Sombrero de tres picos- Miembros de la Guardia Civil Española\u000aMetonimia: "brisa, ecuestre/salta los montes de plomo" \u2192 atardecer con una suave brisa -a la que el poeta atribuye un audaz calificativo: ecuestre-, que cabalga soplando sobre los montes que presentan un color gris azulado: "y una corta brisa, ecuestre, / salta los montes de plomo" <versos 23-24>. Al llamar ecuestre a la brisa se la compara con un caballo. \u000aTiempo y ambiente: El ritmo lento, con comas, de la tercera estrofa. Además, usa el adverbio "despacio". Las aceitunas "aguardan" la noche.Signos de ambiente andaluz: Gitano, Sevilla, aceitunas y olivares ("montes de plomo"), imágenes de la corrida de toros, los guardias civiles, etc\u000aUso del diminutivo: Antoñito- lo hace parecer más simpático y menos ofensivo. Es el diminutivo que se emplea para los chicos de la familia.

Esta falta de fe es lo que lo hace sufrir durante la narracion. Aparecen otros personajes que ayudan a mostrar el tremendo sufrimiento que esta dualidad genera en San Manuel; uno es Lazaro y el otro es Angela, hermana de Lazaro, quien fue criada en la fe religiosa y a asume la actitud que San Manuel busca generar en su pueblo: la creencia sin cuestionamientos, la abstinencia del ocio y la esperance en la vida eterna. Finalmente, San Manuel logra confesar su sufrimiento y su falta de fe a Lazaro.

sVA Valediction: Forbidding Mourning by John Donne
p41607
VSUMMARY: The speaker begins with a weird metaphor of an old man dying. He says that the parting between him and his wife should be like the gentle death of an old man\u2014you can't even tell when he's stopped breathing. Then he shifts gears and compares shallow love to earthquakes that make a big scene and cause a big fuss, but don't have tremendous lasting effects. On the contrary, his love is like the unnoticed, subtle movements of the stars and planets that control the fates of every person (well, according to popular belief). That super-handsy couple can't stand to be apart because their love is based solely on physical contact, but the love he has can stretch any distance because the pair share one soul. But he says that he and his wife are like a compass when drawing a circle. One foot of the compass (Donne) goes way out and travels around, while the other (his wife) stays planted at home and leans after it. But those two compass feet are part of one unit and will always end up back together. \u000aTHEME: love, lust, loyalty

VA group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that emerged in New England in the early to middle 19th century (1830-1860) and evolved into a predominantly literary expression. The adherents believed that knowledge could be arrived at not just through the senses, but through intuition and contemplation of the internal spirit. As such, they professed skepticism of all established religions, believing that Divinity resided in the individual, and the mediation of a church was cumbersome to achieving enlightenment. It represented a new way of understanding truth and knowledge. The roots of the philosophy go back to Germany, specifically the writings and theories of Immanuel Kant.

The breaking of bread and sharing of wine serves as a sense of communion Jesus's blood being spilled represents the love he had for his people.\u000aNew Testament, Matthew 26: 17-30\u000aThe Last Supper or "The Lord's Supper" is said to be the last meal Jesus Christ had with his apostles right before his crucifixion. Jesus was being tracked down by the Romans and was going to be arrested even though he was sinless. Despite the little time he had left, Jesus planned for his twelve disciples to have dinner with him. In this dinner, Jesus predicted that his apostle Peter would deny knowing him three times before the rooster crowed that morning and that one disciple, Judas Iscariot, would betray him. This very meal Jesus Christ created the basis of the Eucharist. He does this by taking the bread at the meal and breaking it into pieces and giving it to his apostles saying " This is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me" and with the wine he said " This wine is the token of God's new covenant to save you- an agreement sealed with blood I will pour out for you." Following the supper Jesus Christ was arrested by the authorities and crucified on a wooden cross for all to see.

sVA Roosevelt
p42273
VAutor: Rubén Darío\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: Podemos hablar de este poema como un texto de orden social y de denuncia ante la intervención del gobierno de los Estados Unidos (representados en la figura de Theodore Roosevelt) en asuntos nacionales que conciernen a países de Latinoamérica, particularmente del Caribe, donde las intromisiones del gobierno norteamericano eran y son constantes. Desde los primeros versos se caracteriza al mandatario como "cazador", referencia biográfica en parte por saberse el fanatismo que profesaba Roosevelt por esta práctica así como a las políticas intervencionistas que llevaba a cabo su gobierno en varios países del mundo. La comparación con Nemrod, el legendario cazador, no hace otra cosa que acentuar esta idea de tiranía desmedida.

p42497
VIn August 1963, this rally was arranged to push for a comprehensive civil rights bill in Congress, to call for national desegregation of schools, and to demand a higher minimum wage. Leaders of the event included A. Philip Randolph, and Martin Luther King Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference. In all, some 200,000 people marched to Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his famous "I Have A Dream" speech. The procession gave a new and fresh impetus to the growing civil rights movement and showed the government that action was needed quickly.

sVChac Mool; Carlos Fuentes
p42665
VGénero: Prosa - Cuento fantástico\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom latinoamericano \u000aContexto histórico: \u000aEl abrazaba la de igualdad social \u2014los ideales de la Revolución Mexicana, pero Filiberto pertenecía a la burguesía de sangre europea. Aunque era muy aficionado a colectar piezas prehispánicas. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a*Carlos Fuentes, enfrenta al mundo europeo de Filiberto contra el mundo prehispánicas de Chac Mool. Mientras Filiberto admira las culturas prehispánicas , él no está preparado para aceptar la supremacía sobre sus tradiciones occidentales. Visto de esta manera , el cuento magistral se ajusta a las categorías de la asimilación , la diversidad , y el nacionalismo. \u000aTiempo: La mayor parte de la narrativa es en "flashback", mientras el narrador lee y trata de interpretar el diario de Filiberto. Pero la historia en sí tiene un movimiento circular; que comienza con la muerte de Filiberto y termina con su féretro siendo llevado a su casa en la Ciudad de México .\u000aDualidad del ser: Por un lado , Chac Mool es una extensión de su ser -el lado mexicano de Filiberto . Por otro lado, sin embargo, él se escapa su herencia mexicana cuando la parte indígena de su psique toma el control de él . En consecuencia , se retira a su lado Europea ( el hotel Alemán en la cosmopolita Acapulco) .\u000aCreación literaria: presenta un juego muy desafiante con el punto de la narrativa. Todo el lector y el narrador saben es lo que leemos en el diario de Filiberto . Este tipo de escritura es muy único, ya que no está destinado a ser entendido por otros . Sus destinatario previsto es el emisor del mensaje. En consecuencia , no entendemos\u000aexactamente lo que estaba pasando en la vida de Filiberto que lo llevara a su muerte . Lo qué sí sabemos es parecía estar alucinando , pensando que la estatua de Chac Mool se estaba transformando en un ser vivo y tratando de dominar a Filiberto. El narrador, como el lector, entiende que esto es puramente fantástica ; sin embargo, cuando el narrador devuelve el cuerpo a casa de Filiberto, es recibido por Chac Mool . El significado es muy Cervantino . ¿Dónde termina la realidad y comienza lo fantástico ? ¿Qué es cierto y qué no es?\u000a**Las dificultades narratológicas que Fuentes demanda la atención constante de su lector \u000aRealidad y fantasía: no puede distinguir fácilmente entre uno y el otro. ¿Es Chac Mool verdadero o fantástico? Las ideas de Filiberto son muy confusas. Son una jerigonza (gibberish) desordenada.\u000aNo hay una realidad fija. Lo que parece fantástico a uno puede ser verdad o normal para otro. El lector ha creído que Chac Mool era una fantasía de Filiberto, pero ahora descubre que no. Es un juego ontológico y existencial.\u000aFinal: Chac Mool está todo pintado, tratando de imitar a un mexicano blanco. \u2022 Chac Mool parece ridículo; no lleva a cabo su imitación de burgués europeo \u2022 Intento simbólico: Cuando el indígena llega a un estado de poder, solo imita la cultura de los europeos.

VCacophony is an unpleasant combination of sounds. Euphony, the opposite, is a pleasant combination of sounds.

The cacophony in Matthew Arnold's lines "And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,/Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honor'd, self-secure, / Didst tread on earth unguess'd at" is probably unintentional.

sVPetrarchan Conceit
p42705
VUsed in love poetry, exploits a particular set of images for comparisons with the despairing lover and his unpitying but idolized mistress. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress 'a cloud of dark disdain'; or else the lady is a sun whose beauty and virtue shine on her lover from a distance.\u000a \u000a"The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using oxymoron, for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of Petrarch became cliche\u0301s in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits in describing his love for Rosaline as 'bright smoke, cold fire, sick health'; and Shakespeare parodies such conceits in Sonnet 130: 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."

(2) third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: a. third person omniscient, in which the narrator, with godlike knowledge, presents the thoughts and actions of any or all characters b. third person limited omniscient, in which the narrator presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all the remaining characters. In addition, be aware that the term point of view carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude.

sVimagery --
p43575
VThe sensory details or figurative language used to describe, arouse emotion, or represent abstractions. On a physical level, imagery uses terms related to the five senses; we refer to visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory imagery. On a broader and deeper level, however, one image can represent more than one thing. For example, a rose may present visual imagery while also representing the color in a woman's cheeks and/or symbolizing some degree of perfection (It is the highest flower on the Great Chain of Being). An author may use complex imagery while simultaneously employing other figures of speech, especially metaphor and simile. In addition, this term can apply to the total of all the images in a work. On the AP exam, pay attention to how an author creates imagery and to the effect of this imagery.

sVrhetorical modes -
p44257
V- This flexible term describes the variety, the conventions, and the purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes and their purposes are as follows: (1) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP language exam essay questions are frequently expository topics. (2) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having an additional aim of urging some form of action. (3) The purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that being described. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straightforward and objective or highly emotional and subjective. (4) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. These four writing modes are sometimes referred to as modes of discourse.

sVpoint of view --
p45161
VIn literature, the perspective from which a story is told. There are two general divisions of point of view and many subdivisions within those. (1) the first person narrator tells the story with the first person pronoun, "I," and is a character in the story. This narrator can be the protagonist, a participant (character in a secondary role), or an observer (a character who merely watches the action). (2) the third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: omniscient and limited omniscient. In the "third person omniscient" point of view, the narrator, with godlike knowledge, presents the thoughts and actions of any or all characters. This all-knowing narrator can reveal what each character feels and thinks at any given moment. The "third person limited omniscient" point of view, as its name implies, presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all remaining characters. This definition applies in questions in the multiple-choice section. However, on the essay portion of the exam, the "point of view" carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude. [For a thorough discussion of point of view, see Story and Structure, the text used by the seniors. In fact, you would be wise to get a copy of it from the thrift store because the introductory sections are wonderful discussions of how literature works.]

VSUMMARY: Prufrock seems to be addressing a potential lover, with whom he would like to "force the moment to its crisis" by somehow consummating their relationship. But Prufrock knows too much of life to "dare" an approach to the woman: In his mind he hears the comments others make about his inadequacies, and he chides himself for "presuming" emotional interaction could be possible at all. The poem moves from a series of fairly concrete (for Eliot) physical settings\u2014a cityscape and several interiors\u2014to a series of vague ocean images conveying Prufrock's emotional distance from the world as he comes to recognize his second-rate status ("I am not Prince Hamlet').\u000aTHEME: love, manipulation, appearances

sVCasandra Luna\u000aSolomon \u000aOld Testament
p46381
VThe story: \u000aSolomon a king of Israel and the son of David and is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. The Judgment of Solomon refers to a story from the Hebrew Bible in which King Solomon of Israel ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child by tricking the parties into revealing their true feelings.Solomon wanted to find out which woman was the baby's mother. He had a wise plan. He asked for a sword. He told a servant to cut the baby in half. He would give half of the baby to each woman. Solomon would not really let the baby be cut in half. He wanted to see what the women would do. He knew the baby's mother would not let her son be hurt.One mother told Solomon not to cut the baby in half. She did not want the baby to be hurt. She loved the baby. She said the other woman could have him. The other woman told Solomon to cut the baby in half.Then Solomon knew who should keep the baby. The real mother did not want the baby to be hurt. Solomon gave the baby to her. Soon all the Israelites heard what had happened. They knew God had made Solomon wise.\u000aMeaning: \u000aThe meaning of the story of king Solomon is the true meaning behind leadership and love. Meanwhile, the people look up to their King, as the grand hero that they trust him enough to deal with grand situations as to decided what to do with an innocent baby. While, the story also portrays the meaning behind the true meaning behind a mother's true love. The mother would much rather have her son/daughter be with someone else than for their child to get hurt, much rather be dead. The love of a mother is so grand that the mother simply wants to protect her child, and love them.

The whole play takes place during the winter. The Lancasters and the New Yorks families have stopped battling thanks to Edward IV. Richard resents and loathes his brother's power and starts to kill people in order to become king. He manipulates a woman into marriage and becomes king after Edward dies. He then starts killing even more people, most importantly Edward's 2 sons since Richard is a temporary king and will be replaced by Edward's sons. He is still unhappy about his deformity (he was born with a hunchback) and has a terrible dream. The ghosts of all the people he had killed warn him of his death to come. Richmond, a French king and leader of the Lancasters, invades England and kills Richard. Richard accepts his death and Richmond becomes Henry VII. He unites the 2 families and peace settles between the land.

sVComo la vida misma
p48179
VAutor: Rosa Montero\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Tiempo y espacio: Tema y técnica\u000aResumen: Una persona sale a la calle a combatir casi literalmente contra el tráfico y la congestión. El\u000ahecho de poder llegar a su destino se convierte en una lucha campal contra todos los conductores y personas a su alrededor. La narradora aborrece, odia e insulta a todos los que junto a ella compiten por unos metros de asfalto= calle. Sólo cuando logra aparcarse en un lugar, gracias a la generosidad de un hombre de mediana edad, la narradora demuestra cualidades humanas positivas como la bondad y el agradecimiento. El hombre, tan abrumado y ansioso como la narradora, se sorprende por la muestra de agradecimiento en este ambiente hostil. Son incapaces de comportarse o comunicarse cordialmente. Irónicamente, la narradora crítica la misma insensibilidad que ella había demostrado hasta ese momento.

Because of this stereotype, it is hard for men to understand women, and women end up bearing this double burden in which they are able to understand their position as the emotional outlet for their family (in part due to the feminist movement) but cannot change their men.

sVSoneto XXIII/ En tanto que de rosa y azucena; Garcilaso de la Vega
p48873
VGénero: Poesía del Siglo de Oro - Soneto renacentista (lírica)\u000aSiglo: XVI\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGarcilaso's "En tanto que de rosa y azucena" is a "classical" Renaissance sonnet with a carpe diem theme. It contains all of the characteristics of the Latin theme: extolling the beauty of the woman, an erotic subtext, and the warning to seize the day, as time will rob her of her beauty and seductiveness. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aMetaphor vs. metonymy: This might be a good place to emphasize once again the difference between metaphor and metonymy. In a metaphor, there is an explicit sign with which to compare. For instance, in "En tanto que de rosa y azucena / se muestra la color de vuestro gesto" there is an explicit referent to the woman's face ("vuestro gesto"). One can safely assume that we are dealing with chromatic symbolism: the red of the rose and the white of the lily refer to the coloration of the woman's complexion. However, in metonymy there is no specific reference point, so the reader must figure it out on his or her own. This occurs in the Garcilaso poem with "antes que el tiempo airado / cubra de nieve la hermosa cumbre." Here we have to infer that the "tiempo airado" refers to the cold blasts of winter, the "hermosa cumbre" is the woman's head, and the "nieve" refers to gray hairs (before winter dumps its snow on the mountain = a woman with gray hair). The metonymy is much more difficult than metaphor, and it is used more frequently in Spanish poetry than in English, where it is often referred to as a \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE. \u000aOposición de colores: Cálido (rosa, ardiente, encender, oro, alegre primavera, dulce fruto, etc.); blancura (azucena, nieve, tiempo airado, viento helado, etc.). \u000aMetonimia: Tiempo airado, nevada. \u2022 Los colores cálidos representan la primavera y los blancos el invierno. "Tiempo airado"- clima "enojado", o sea "mal tiempo". \u000aTiempo: El tiempo que pasa rápidamente. \u2022 Son iguales. \u2022 El tiempo pasa rápidamente. La primavera se convierte en invierno (la juventud pasa a la vejez). El tiempo cambia todo. La rosa del primer verso se marchita en la última estrofa.

sVComo La Vida Misma; Rosa Montero
p48875
VGénero: Prosa contemporánea española\u000aSiglo: XXI\u000aMovimiento: Feminismo\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTiempo y espacio: Rosa Montero crea un espacio denso en un lapso muy corto de tiempo. Ella describe un atasco de tráfico y el estado psicológico del narrador de la mente en el más mínimo detalle . El lector entra en el espacio de la narración , porque todos hemos tenido una experiencia similar y tenía reacciones similares .\u000aNarración: En el presente, a veces en primera persona, pero principalmente se desdobla y habla de sí mismo en forma de tú. ¿Qué es el efecto de narrar de este modo? El presente da un sentido de inmediatez. La forma de tú hace sentir al lector como parte de la experiencia. \u2022 También te hace sentir presente en lo que está ocurriendo. Casi todo el mundo ha tenido las mismas experiencias.\u000aTécnica narrativa: el narrador se dirige a sí mismo, pero con la forma del tú involucra al lector también. \u2022 Los conductores se comunican entre ellos con gestos y miradas. \u2022 El dialogo emplea solamente en la forma del fluir de la conciencia. \u2022 Muchos detalles minuciosos combinados con descripciones visuales, pensamientos, opiniones, expresiones, etc., todos mezclados para producir un cuadro auténtico, muy realista.\u000aHipérbole: "Doscientos mil coches apretados junto al tuyo". Sí, es muy natural. Por ejemplo: Tardé un siglo en llegar. \u2022 causan humor. \u000aExpresiones coloquiales: Imbécil, idiota, cretino, chalao, etc. Al ser muy informal, el lector se relaja ante el lenguaje que él mismo, a lo mejor, usa en estos instantes. \u000aDes/humanización del conductor: Por poco atropella a una anciana y no le importa. \u2022 Cuando le da las gracias al señor que le permitió estacionarse. \u000aIronía: El narrador cree que los otros han sido agresivos, cuando él mismo ha sido tan agresivo como los demás.

The indicative mood is used only for factual sentences. For example, "Joe eats too quickly." The subjunctive mood is used to express conditions contrary to fact. For example, "If I were you, I'd get another job." The imperative mood is used for commands. For example, "Shut the door!" The second meaning of mood is literary, meaning the prevailing atmosphere or emotional aura of a work. Setting, tone, and events can affect the mood. In this usage, mood is similar to tone and atmosphere.

sVElements of a Tragic Hero
p49479
Va. "The tragic hero is a man of noble stature. He is not an ordinary man but a man with outstanding quality and greatness about him" (Perrine).\u000ab. "The tragic hero is good, though not perfect" (Perrine) His fall is a result of hamartia.\u000ac. "The hero's downfall, therefore, is his own fault, the result of his own free choice--not the result of pure accident or villainy or some overriding malignant fate" (Perrine)\u000a \u000ad. "Nevertheless, the hero's misfortune is not wholly deserved. The punishment exceeds the crime. We do not come away from the tragedy with the feeling that 'He got what he had coming to him' but rather with the sad sense of a waste of human potential" (Perrine)\u000ae. "Yet the tragic fall is not pure loss. Though it may result in the protagonist's death, it involves, before his death, some increase in awareness, some gain in self-knowledge" (Perrine)

VGénero: Poesía ( verso libre) \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: La vanguardia- Surrealismo hispanoamericano\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aAunque el arte surrealista intenta captar una super realidad, en sus obras, este ambiente se expresa con elementos de sorpresa y signos yuxtapuestos de un modo ilógico que lo alejan de la realidad reconocible. Es como la realidad de los sueños, los cuales a veces no tienen sentido y, sin embargo, revelan los secretos importantes de nuestra subconciencia. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aExistencialismo: La agonía de la existencia está en exhibición en el poema. Se construye un mundo surrealista donde los signos son inconexos e incomprensibles . Un hombre camina a través del espacio creado confundido, atormentado , y sorprendido por el mundo que él ve y no entiende. \u000aCansancio ( yo lírico 1eras tres estrofas): de su persona física, de su existencia, de su rutina diaria, del mundo que lo circunda. \u000aEstrofa 4 y 5: Ocurrencias divertidas pero bastante grotescas- matar a una monja y asustar a un notario. \u000aSignos subterráneos: Raíz, "extendido . . . hacia abajo, en las tripas mojadas de la tierra", tumba (bodega con muertos), subterráneo, etc. \u000aAngustia (estrofa 7): El dolor de ver a tanta gente sufrir. \u000aImágenes surrealistas: Los huesos que salen de las ventanas de los hospitales, zapaterías que huelen a vinagre, intestinos colgados de las puertas de las casas, dentaduras en cafeteras, espejos que lloran, ombligos en todas partes, etc. Signos grotescos: "intestinos colgando de las puertas", "dentaduras olvidadas en una cafetera", etc. \u000aSignos - Centro urbano: Verbos-Empujar, pasearse, cruzar. Edificios- hospitales, zapaterías, calles, casas, oficinas de ortopedia, patios, ropa secándose, etc. \u000aVerso libre: No tiene número fijo de sílabas ni rima. \u2022 Típico del Surrealismo, el poema carece de una organización rígida de ideas, así que el verso libre es apropiado para un poema libre.\u000aTono: Irónico y de decepción. Con desesperación, repugnancia, pena, furia, etc. Casi todos los signos ayudan a expresar el tono angustioso del poema. \u000aDegradación del ser: Se cansa de las partes de su cuerpo y de seguir sustanciándose (absorbiendo líquidos y comiendo). \u2022 Todo lo que ve en su paseo es antinatural; las cosas no son como deben ser (la ropa recién lavada produce gotas sucias, etc.). \u000aMetáfora: El hombre como raíz- Para absorber agua; para que se mantenga viva; etc. \u2022El yo lírico no quiere vivir; no quiere tener la responsabilidad de ser un sostén; etc. \u000aFiguras retóricas: \u000aAnáforas: Sucede/sucede, sólo/sólo, no/no, y/y, a/a, hay/hay, etc.; \u000aAliteraciones: "sucede que me canso de ser hombre" combina /s/ y /e/, sonidos nasales en /m/ y /n/, etc.; \u000aOnomatopeya/Polisíndeton: estrofa 8; estrofas 8 y 9. \u000aRitmo (últimos versos del poema): Es como una gradación descendente con aliteración en /l/. Además de su efecto fónico, hace que el verso se lea despacio, como gotas que caen. \u000aPersonificación (final): Los espejos y la ropa lloran. Pero las lágrimas, en vez de ser limpias, como se esperaría de ropa lavada, son sucias

Va Hebrew whom God commanded to go to Nineveh to tell the people there to stop sinning. He didn't want to and tried to escape by boat, but God made a great storm. When the others on board realized that Jonah was the person God was mad at, they threw him overboard. He was then swallowed by a whale.
