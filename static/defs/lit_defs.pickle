Word spread of the beauty of Psyche so men left Venus;s alter (Aphrodite) and were now worshiping Psyche instead. Angry that she was losing to a mortal, Venus told her son Cupid to make Psyche fall in love with a hideous beast. Sneaking into her room at night Cupid was ready to prick Psyche with his arrow but was distracted by her beauty and startled that she was able to see him, Cupid prick himself with his own arrow. He abandoned his plans and fled the scene. Psyche was left alone despite her beauty and her two sisters were off now happily married. The king and queen asked Apollo for help because they feared their daughter upset the gods. Apollo told them that their daughter was meant to have no mortal lover. They sent her to be with her husband who awaited her, she stayed with him but was never allowed to see his face. A visit from her sisters drove Psyche to sneak into her husband's room and kill the "monster." She found out that it was cupid who was her secret husband and he felt betrayed by her not trusting him and her sisters instead so he left her. She was miserable and in order to find him again she went to be a servant for Venus herself; Venus sent her to get a box filled with Proserpine's beauty. Psyche opened the box to only be put into a Stygian sleep. Cupid recovered from his wound went to Jupiter and pleaded for Psyche's recovery. Jupiter then granted Psyche immortality and the two were then married and eventually had a daughter named Pleasure.

VSince Prometheus stole the fire that was supposed to be given to the Gods, Zeus became angry and wanted to find revenge by punishing the people. So Pandora, the first women on earth, was created as a punishment to mankind, who was given gifts from the Gods. Hephaestus shaped her perfectly, Aphrodite gave her femininity, Athena taught her crafts, and Hermes taught her to be deceitful, stubborn, and curious. She was given a box that contained "special gifts" according to the Gods, but was told that she was never allowed to open it. One day Hermes took Pandora to Prometheus' brother Epimetheus to become his wife. Although Prometheus warned his brother to not receive anything from the gods, he was astonished by her beauty and accepted the offer. Pandora's curiosity got the best of her, which led to the opening of the box that illnesses and hardships that the Gods hid. She closed the box quickly to keep the evil spirits from coming out closed hope inside instead. Zeus' goal was to make mankind understand to not disrespect the Gods and Pandora was the right person because of her curiosity.\u000a\u000aWhen people refer to the phrase, "to open Pandora's box" it means to complete an action that may seem innocent, with no effect, but in reality that small action leads to severe consequences.

p1949
VAutor: Francisco de Quevedo\u000aÉpoca:\u000aTema: Tiempo y espacio: Tema y técnica\u000aResumen: El poeta hace referencia a España, su país, y cuenta que ahora se ve debilitada y derrumbada pero antes era gloriosa y fuerte. Se refiere a que su país ya desgastado por tanto malestar ya no da más y deja su fuerzas de lado. Luego, el personaje contempla los campos y la naturaleza olvidándose de su melancolía. Se hace oscuro y lo que encontraba sereno y bello se torna tan desalentado y rendido como su patria. Contempla la estropeada habitación de su hogar hecha pedazos, ya no es un lugar acogedor para él. Se ve derrotado por el paso del tiempo, pierde las esperanzas y se ve sin salida. Se encuentra solo, sin opción que enfrentar la muerte, lo único que le queda. En conclusión, en el poema el autor hace una reflexión de toda la situación en la que se encuentra, en la realidad y en el poema. Lamenta el estado en que se encuentra su patria pero luego se da cuenta que ese problema exterior se vuelve personal y se encuentra tan mal como esta el país, desgastado, viejo, solo dejado a la muerte.

p3123
VAutor: Sabine Ulibarrí\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La imaginación y la creación literaria\u000aResumen: Este cuento se trata de un hombre contando una experiencia que pasó cuando tenía quince años. Cuando era niño, estaba obsesionado con un caballo blanco, el cual llenó su juventud de fanatsía y poesía. También todo el pueblo estaba fascinado con este animal. Hablaron de él con entusiasmo y admiración por que era libre y nadie lo pudo controlar. La historia toma lugar en un campo cerca de un pueblo pequeño. El narrador sólo lo vio dos veces en su vida. La primera vez que lo vio fue durante el verano. El narrador sintió una "eternidad momentánea" o sea sólo duró un momento pero nunca lo olvidará. Desde entonces, el caballo mago cambió sus sueños, llenándolos de resonancia, luz, y violencia. Cuando llego el invierno, la gente del pueblo comentaba que el caballo había regresado y que adaba por algún rincon. Por lo cual, al narrador le se le hacía más ideal y misterioso.\u000aCuando lo vio por segunda vez, se vieron al mismo tiempo y se quedaron inmóviles. El narrador lo siguió, observando las manchas negras que tenía en su cuerpo. Entonces, el narrador lo trató de lazar y se le hizo mucho más fácil de lo que había pensado. Aunque se sintió verdugo, lo hizo por que era su sueño desde que era niño. Despúes de haberlo lazado, se sintió conquistador. Cuando pasó con el mago por el pueblo, el caballo trató de escapar pero se caía. Allí el narrador se sintió mal por el caballo pero siguió por el camino hacía su casa. Llegaron a la casa del narrador y él decidio dejar el mago en un potrero, donde ningún caballo se había escapado. El narrador no durmió bien esa noche por estar pensando en el mago. Cuando se despertó, no encontraba el caballo por ningún lado. Se puso nervioso al darse cuenta que el mago había brincado la cerca de alambre de púas. Vio que al otro lado de la cerca había huellas con gotas de sangre y se puso a llorar. Despúes de un rato, apareció su padre y le puso el brazo sobre el hombro y se quedaron viendo las huellas del mago.

sV"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and lone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me." (Shelly 92)\u000a\u000aThe initial tone of the piece is one of... \u000aa. Jealousy \u000ab. Self-pity \u000ac. Intrigue \u000ad. Indifference \u000ae. Mystery
p3141
V(C) The creature longs to communicate and is at least able to read. With the statement of the creature being moved by what he reads and the usage of the words "wonder", "awe", and "exciting", the reader can infer that the creature is fascinated by literature. Jealousy and self-pity are evident in the second tone, while indifference and mystery are rather unsuitable.

Porter - (1913 novel) classical of children's literature, first of later sequel\u000a\u000aPollyanna Whittier is a young orphan who is sent to live with her wealthy but austere aunt in Vermont after her dad has past away. Her aunt is not fond in taking Pollyanna in but feels that it is her duty to her late sister. Pollyanna's philosophy allows her to get through life under her aunt's household and make new friends in town. Her philosophy centers on the "Glad Game," an optimistic and positive attitude she learned from her father through an incident on Christmas. She was hoping for a doll, but instead received crutches. Her father told her to look at the good side, "we didn't need to use them," and she makes up the game on the spot. Her optimism is put to the test when she is struck by an automobile and becomes paralyzed from her legs. Unable to find things to be glad about the townspeople encourage her and she becomes glad that she at least has had her legs. She eventually learns to walk again and be appreciative of her legs.\u000a\u000aBeing called or calling others a "Pollyanna" refers to a personality type characterized by optimism evident even at the most discouraging circumstances.

Because of Cain our world is violent and corrupt. You will get treated the way you treat others. \u000aOld Testament \u000aGenesis 4:4\u000aCain and Abel were created after Adam and Eve were kicked out of the Garden of Eden because they disobeyed god and were sinners. Cain was born first and worked as a farmer, Abel worked as a shepherd. Their parents asked them to sacrifice a lamb in order to show god that they were sorry for their mistakes. Cain offered fresh fruit from the ground, but Abel offered the fat portion of the firstborn. God advised Cain to do the same in order to gain the same respect as Abel but Cain was not satisfied and ended up killing his own brother in the fields. God now saw Cain as a sinner and son of the devil. God cursed Cain and told him he is not allowed to be a farmer and would become a wanderer. "Driven from the ground, which opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand." God would punish him by making Cain live with guilt his whole life. Cain wanted a much more severe punishment but god's gracefulness protected Cain from getting killed by the people. Cain created a city and his people had no knowledge of god.

p3979
Va perspective pinned to a single character, whether a first-person-or a third-person-centered consciousness, so that we cannot know for sure what is going on in the minds of other characters; thus, when the focal character leaves the room in a story we must go, too, and cannot know what is going on while our "eyes" or "camera" is gone. A variation on this, which generally has no name and is often lumped with the omniscient point of view, is the point of view that can wander like a camera from one character to another and close in or move back but cannot (or at least does not) get inside anyone's head and does not present from the inside any character's thoughts.

p4083
VIt is a medieval text in Spain and it is a collection of stories. After a man and a woman get married, the man feels like he has all of the power and feels like the wife cannot serve him just like the animals cannot serve him. He treats the position of the woman as if she was one of the animals as well. She has a reputation of not listening to her husband either. The story is very chauvinistic and it shows the TRADITIONAL gender roles at the time. One of the major themes to take away from this story is that if you cannot show what you want or who you are at the beginning, then you will never be able to show that feeling later in the long run. The story is in a modern perspective.

Styles can be called flowery, explicit, succinct, rambling, bombastic, commonplace, incisive, laconic, etc. (2) Classification of authors to a group and comparison of an author to similar authors.

VBacchus, who is known more as Dionysus, was the God of Fertility and Wine. Dionysus had two natures, one that brought Joy and Ecstasy and the other is brutal and has Blinding rage, which is how people could be when they drink wine. Dionysus was the son of Zeus and Semele, a mortal, but did not know she was being seduced by Zeus. When she was tricked by Hera to ask for one wish from her lover, which was to show his true self, innocently asked Zeus and when she saw him and all his glory, she died. Luckily, Zeus saved Dionysus by stitching him into his thigh. Hera, wife of Zeus, was jealous and had the titans kill him, but he was saved and then protected by his father. He would then roam the world, have followers, and drink a lot of wine, but for spiritual reasons. He was also able to bring his mother back from the underworld, something that is almost impossible. So, he was known for rebirth after death, surviving the titans, and the belief that you could gain great power from drinking wine.\u000a\u000aI would have to say that this shows that people could be two faced or at least have different personalities. You might be nice and energetic with some people, but aggressive and bitter with others. Also, the sudden changes in personality when someone drinks.\u000a\u000aWhen people associate with Bacchus, they would allude him as either a wild drunken party or celebration with wine, referred to as Bacchanal.

p4675
VAutor: Tomás Rivera\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: Las sociedades en contacto: Pluralismo racial y desigualdad económica\u000aResumen: En esta obra, un niño narra sus vivencias y las de otros trabajadores migrantes. El autor nos presenta la vida de los campesinos de Texas durante la década de 1950 con todos sus pesares y alegrías. Es una recreación de la dificultosa vida de los inmigrantes mexicanos y sus descendientes, que llegaban a ese país en busca de trabajo y una esperanza para el futuro. El narrador es un joven perdido en las sombras de la explotación laboral y la mistificación de su vida por las instituciones de la sociedad. En el capítulo seleccionado, el padre es llevado a la casa debido al exceso de sol que le hizo vomitar y retorcerse de calambres mientras trabajaba toda la familia en el campo. Hasta el más pequeño de nueve años sufria las consecuencias del arduo trabajo. Sólo esperaba el nuevo dia para continuar su rutina de trabajo. El personaje-narrador desafía a la tierra: "la tierra no se come a nadie, ni el sol tampoco"/ "todavia no me puedes tragar. Algún día, sí. Pero yo ni sabré". Esta escena denota un momento de rebeldía en la vida del adolescente.

p4975
V1. Read the literary work and take notes on what you could write about once you get the prompt. Read the assigned material more than once. \u000a2. Take some time to let the material sink into your mind. Give yourself time to think about what you've read and eventually consider how you'll tackle the problem.\u000a3. Make a rough outline, the go forth writing a first draft of the paper with the outline as a guide. \u000a4. Revise your paper, which may require a rewriting of the paper or of certain aspects of the paper. \u000a5. Continue revising, and make sure all your stances are firm and forthright and now weak and wishy-washy.\u000a6. Revise your paper for effectiveness of expression. \u000a7. Type your final copy and make sure to follow all of your instructors editorial policies. \u000a8. Reread your final copy to check for any errors or small grammar mistakes - this is the most crucial of all the steps.

VThis saying comes from William Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice. This tells the story of a young Venetian named Bassanio who needs to borrow money so that he can impress Portia, a wealthy Venetian heiress. Antonio, his good friend and merchant, does not have the money to lend him because it is invested in his fleet which is at sea. He suggests that Bassanio borrow the money from Shylock, a wealthy Jewish man, and use his name to give him a good word. Shylock agrees to the loan but if the money is not paid back in three months, Antonio must give Shylock a pound of his flesh. Antonio agrees confident that he will have the money but two of his ships are later wrecked and once the three months come to an end, he does not have the money. Shylock demands the pound of flesh immediately partially because his daughter ran away to marry a Christian. At the "trial" a random lawyer and clerk, secretly Portia and Nerissa in disguise, defend Antonio and say that Shylock may only remove the flesh if he can do it without slipping the blood of a Christian. Since this is impossible Shylock leaves with nothing.

sVSir Gawain and the Green Knight

VAn uninvited guest appears; oddly enough, he is green. Clearly, some magic is afoot. Then, after interrupting the celebration, the Green Knight proposes a challenge. Is there anyone brave enough to take the knight's ax and serve him a blow on the neck in return for a blow from the Green Knight's ax in exactly one year? Understandably, the knights are caught off guard. Even King Arthur is not sure whether or not he should accept, but after the Green Knight mocks him, he agrees. No one can dare call King Arthur a coward. However, Sir Gawain, a heroic knight and Arthur's nephew, rises to the challenge. Grabbing the Green Knight's ax, he boldly severs the knight's head, and, unbelievably, the knight picks up his head off the floor and rides off, after instructing Sir Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in exactly one year. Sir Gawain is sure he has sealed his own doom. Some months later, Sir Gawain leaves Camelot to find the Green Knight, and his own death, no doubt. People mourn as he leaves, for he is known for his deeds of valor and chivalry.

VThe denotation of a word is its dictionary definition. The connotation of a world is its emotional content. In Robert Frost 'Mending Wall," two neighbors walk a property line each on his own side of the wall of loose stones. As they walk, they pick up and replace stones that have fallen. Frost thinks it's unnecessary to replace the stones since they have no cows to damage each other's property. The neighbor only says " Good fences make good neighbors." The wall, in this case, is both boundary (denotation) and a barrier that prevents Frost and his neighbor from getting to know each other, a force preventing involvement(connotation).

sVDeconstructionist
p7741
VA critical theory, literary works do not yield fixed, single meanings. Deconstruction, form of philosophical and literary analysis, derived mainly from work begun in the 1960s by the French philosopher Jacques Derrida, that questions the fundamental conceptual distinctions, or "oppositions," in Western philosophy through a close examination of the language and logic of philosophical and literary texts. In the 1970s the term was applied to work by Derrida, Paul de Man, J. Hillis Miller, and Barbara Johnson, among other scholars. In the 1980s it designated more loosely a range of radical theoretical enterprises in diverse areas of the humanities and social sciences. In polemical discussions about intellectual trends of the late 20th-century, deconstruction was sometimes used pejoratively to suggest nihilism and frivolous skepticism. In popular usage the term has come to mean a critical dismantling of tradition and traditional modes of thought.

sV"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and lone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me." (Shelly 92) \u000a \u000aIn the excerpt, the author uses which of the following rhetorical strategies? \u000a\u000aa. Metaphor \u000ab. Assonance \u000ac. Colloquialism \u000ad.

Examples include explanatory captions or illustrations projected on a screen; actors stepping out of character to lecture, summarize, or sing songs; and stage designs that do not represent any locality but that, by exposing the lights and ropes, keep the spectators aware of being in a fictional environment.

p10387
V-one version of Catch-22 keeps Yossarian flying combat mission after combat mission: Doc Daneeka cannot ground him for insanity unless he asks, but if he asks to be grounded, then he must be sane\u000a-in this sense, Catch-22 is a piece of circular reasoning that keeps Yossarian trapped in a paradox that determines whether he lives or dies, even though it is made only of words\u000a-Catch-22 has many other permutations, most notably in the final, general principle stated by the old Italian woman in the ruined brothel: "they have a right to do anything we can't stop them from doing"\u000a-this description of Catch-22 proves what Yossarian has known all along: Catch-22 does not really exist\u000a-it is just a name made up for an illogical argument that justifies what is really going on\u000a-behind Catch-22 stands an unswerving principle: might makes right\u000a-Catch-22 also manifests itself even when it is not explicitly named\u000a-both the doctor and the Chaplain have been caught up in their own versions of Catch-22, since war drastically undermines the premises of their professions and yet calls upon them to practice those professions in the name of war\u000a-even Heller's style is in a way a Catch-22; the dialogue leaps haphazardly from one comment to another, often arriving at a point exactly opposite of that which the person speaking is trying to express\u000a\u000a**Catch-22 Definition**\u000aA dilemma or difficult circumstance from which there is no escape because of mutually conflicting or dependent conditions.

VPyramus and Thisbe are a couple of young Babylonians in love. Unfortunately, their families totally hate each other. The star-crossed lovers whisper sweet nothings through a crack in the wall that separates their houses, until they eventually can't take it anymore and decide to elope.\u000aBut when Thisbe shows up under the mulberry tree where they're supposed to meet, a bloody-jawed lioness is hanging out there. Thisbe screams and runs, leaving her shawl behind. Pyramus arrives a little while later and finds the bloody lioness ripping apart the shawl. Uh oh\u2014we can see where this is headed.\u000aAssuming Thisbe has been devoured, he stabs himself with his sword. Later, Thisbe returns, figures out the horrible thing that's happened, and stabs herself with Pyramus's sword, too. To this day, the formerly white berries of the mulberry tree are stained red with the blood of these tragic lovers.\u000aMeaning: \u000aThe story of Pyramus and Thisbe demonstrates the effect of the love of two-star crossed lovers. The effect that two parents/families hatred can affect the love of two persons. In addition, they are forced to hide and turn something positive into something negative; actions have consequences.

sVtraditional wisdom
p11065
Vwhen a wrong or an unsuitable practice is justified on grounds that it follows a traditional accepted way of doing things. It is difficult for some people to change because change brings risks, inevitably. (ie: not wanting to eliminate biased practices based on gender, racial, or religious biases because that's the way things have ALWAYS been done in the "good ole days."). Those who benefit from these practices find it hard to entertain the idea that there could possibly be anything wrong with them. We do want to learn from past experiences, so we shouldn't assume that just because things have been done in the past, that it is right to do that thing NOW. All innovations go against past practices (From the introduction of plows that dig deeper furrows (a practice resisted at first by the North African farmers) to the elimination of practices based on racial, religious, or gender bias in the US). Tradition should be a guide not a jailer. Jeremy Bentham once said that when someone is guilty of abuse of power, the ONLY way for them to defend that abuse is to use a fallacy. Therefore it is important for them to keep the people stupid so that they can't distinguish truth from error.(under Two Wrongs category)

The idea of devotion was represented in many religions and in this story God had payed a visit to Abraham testing his devotion to him which ended up with him agreeing to sacrifice his child. Abraham and Isaac had set forth on a trip to worship god but Isaac hadn't realized he was the lamb for this sacrifice. Abraham loaded his donkey and went forth with his son and two servants to the mountain. After leaving behind the servants, Isaac and Abraham started the fire and Isaac spoke up questioning where the lamb to sacrifice was. Abraham answered "god will provide it for us". As Abraham was beginning the sacrifice and angel called out to him, telling him not to lay a hand on his child for god has realized his devotion to killing his son, his only son. The angel called from heaven a second time saying that for his devotion god has agreed that he will be blessed and his descendants will be many, his children will take the land of his enemies and will be blessed since he had obeyed him.

VFrancisco de Quevedo: En este soneto que se publico unos años despues de la muerte del poeta. Quevedo,nos deja ver su agonia antes la inevitable llegada de la muerte ,y con bellas imagenes y metaforas gracias a su poder poetico,nos narra el fatal destino de la humanidad,que incapaz de vencer al tiempo vamos sintiendo el deterioro paulatino de nuestras capacidades fisicas sin mas consuelo que el de esperar el final. Y es importante destacar en este poema la astucia de este gran poeta español para decirnos que EL SOL ---para mi los mas ricos,el rey---tambien ha envejecido,y que cansado y muerto de sed bebe agua en un arroyo semejando su final.No podriamos olvidar mencionar el final de los animales que se encontraban descansando en las imaginarias sombras de los arboles del monte,incapaz de poder caminar y robarle un poco de luz al sol. Sencillamente es un juego de palabras donde nos muestra desde 3 angulos diferentes el similar destino de todos los seres vivos.

Therefore there's no need for complaining about our earth or ourselves as individuals. \u000aWe are meant to be the way we are.\u000a\u000aBefore God came into involvement with the world, it was once empty, dark, and desolate. Once he came into play, he started to create things that would help us all (his people) in the future. The first day, he created the terms "night" and "day", separating the dark from the light. The second day, he created a dome to separate our two bodies of water. One of which he named "sky". On the third day, he separated the wet from the dry; naming the wet the "seas" and the dry the "land". He also created plants and trees which were planted on both wet and dry. The fourth day, he created the sun, moon, and the stars in order for us to receive light and to tell day and night apart. This would also tell us about the year, days, and seasons. On the fifth day, he created all living creatures of the sea and all winged birds which he multiplied so they could fill the seas and sky. On the sixth day, he created animals to fill the earth as well as human life. On the seventh day, he had finished creating therefore rested. He was extremely satisfied with the way that he molded the earth.

sVsymbol/symbolism -
p14915
V- Generally, anything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete--such as an object, action, character, or scene--that represents something more abstract. However, symbols and symbolism can be much more complex. One system classifies symbols in three categories: (1) Natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to represent ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge). (2) Conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scales of justice for lawyers). (3) Literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated as is the whale in Moby Dick and the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

In the Inferno, Dante is led by the poet Virgil into the underworld, where he experiences and describes each of the nine circles of hell. The sign at the entrance to Hell reads: "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."

And, no one thing is highly more superior than another. There are several things that come our way that have the same effect as others; just like the author states that taking drugs takes the place of dying because in both, one is relaxed and asleep.\u000a\u000a\u000aHoly fourteen-line sonnet from memoir Death be Not Proud by John Donne (1633)\u000a\u000aIn this poem, we learn that death is not as powerful as we make it seem. The author makes death a person and tells him that he shouldn't feel too powerful because not everyone is afraid of him. The reason why he isn't as powerful is because we don't really die, but simply move on to living in the afterlife. Death feels like he is very mighty and superior but the author tells him that there is no hierarchy stating that he is on top of everything else. The author also tells him that even though some desire death due to suffering in the earth, the rest that they receive from death can be received elsewhere therefore he isn't as strong as he feels..

sVComposition Fallacy
p16733
Vsometimes called the "salesman" fallacy; it's committed when someone assumes that a particular item must have a certain property because all of its parts have the same property.

The fallacy of division is the opposite or mirror image of the composition fallacy, when you assume that all or some of the parts of an item have a particular property because the item as a whole has it. Ie: people think that a large, fancy hotel must have large, fancy rooms, when the rooms could actually be quite tiny.

Very long sentences may be intended to suggest confusion or to simulate a rapid flow of ideas or emotions; or perhaps to illustrate the enormity or weight of a situation. Very short sentences may be intended to emphasize factuality or to stress a key idea. Parallelism may be used to create rhythm or stir emotion. Repetition may be used to stress a key idea or to convey an emotion. From the Greek "taxis"- order, arrangement; sun- together.

VThis essay is about the unification of Latin American and the idea of how one defines an "American." The essay states the prejudice that the United States has on other parts of America and how they state things and rights for all Americans, even though some people who are Americans don't receive those rights, such as Latin Americans. The United States poses lots of threats on other parts of America and because they have to much power, other countries cannot control them nor have any say in anything. Martí suggests a unification but isn't possible due to United States' imperialistic power. A theme in this essay relates to the prejudices other American races face and how one society under the American branch controls all the other parts.

p19627
VArrogance can truly have serious consequences. It's one to show that being in love can make people do very crazy things--just like Apollo chased Daphne. Even though Daphne was turned into a tree in the end, Apollo treated her as a sacred person. \u000a -Apollo had just killed the Python, a giant snake, and he was truly acting although he was full of himself. Apollo comes across cupid and makes fun of his archery--Cupid does not like this. Cupid decides to punish him, shooting him with a gold arrow while shooting Daphne, a nymph, with a lead arrow. In all, the gold arrow makes Apollo fall in love with Daphne, while it makes Daphne be totally grossed out by love. In the end, Daphne does not want him and her father protects her by turning her into a tree in order for Apollo to leave her alone. Apollo is very upset but continues to love Daphne--making the laurel HIS sacred tree. Apollo also decides to wear a laurel leaf crown which signifies that he has Daphne. \u000a The meaning of this story is again, arrogance can truly have serious consequences--just like Apollo's consequences.

sVparallelism --
p19833
VAlso referred to as parallel construction or parallel structure, this term comes from Greek roots meaning "beside one another." It refers to the grammatical or rhetorical framing of words, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs to give structural similarity. This can involve, but is not limited to, repetition of a grammatical element such as a preposition or verbal phrase. A famous example of parallelism begins Charles Dickens's novel A Tale of Two Cities: "It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity . . . ." The effects of parallelism are numerous, but frequently they act as an organizing force to attract the reader's attention, add emphasis and organization, or simply provide a musical rhythm.

sVSYMBOLISM
p20007
VThe use of words or objects to stand for or represent other things. When Hamlet asks, "Will you play upon this pipe?" he is expressing his awareness that his old "friends," Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, have been hired by his uncle as spies. They are attempting to manipulate Hamlet the way a musician manipulates an instrument. A symbol is something that stands for something else. Symbolism is more flexible than ALLEGORY. It may convey a number of meanings. The symbol of the great white whale in Herman Melville's Moby Dick, for example, may stand for the devil, nature, fate, or the Divine. In the Chronicles of Narnia, the White Stag may stand for Jesus, and all of the (at this time) unfulfilled promises of God. Like the Stag, Jesus calls us to follow and promises us unending joys (in heaven). The stag was a symbol for Christ in the Middle Ages; the antlers have been compared to a tree of life; the whiteness of Lewis's stag adds a dimension of purity.

V"The effect of purgation or purification achieved by tragic drama, according to Aristotle's argument in his Poetics(4th century BC), Aristotle wrote that a tragedy* should succeed ""in arousing pity and fear in such a way as to accomplish a catharsis of such emotions"". There has been much dispute about his meaning, but Aristotle seems to be rejecting Plato's hostile view of poetry as an unhealthy emotional stimulant. His metaphor of emotional cleansing has been read as a solution to the puzzle of audiences' pleasure or relief in witnessing the disturbing events enacted in tragedies. Another interpretation is that it is the protagonist's guilt that is purged rather than the audience's feeling of terror. Adjective:cathartic"

VAutor: Alfonsina Storni\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La construcción del género: Machismo y feminismo\u000aResumen: El poema habla de la inequidad que existe entre hombres y mujeres en las relaciones y en el ámbito sexual. En la primera y segunda estrofa, Storni nos presenta la imagen que una mujer podía mostrar de su sexualidad en su época: cómo debía ser, qué podía y qué no podía hacer. A partir de la tercera estrofa, Storni introduce un nuevo elemento temático en su poema. Si está permitido y bien visto que el hombre sea iniciado en la actividad sexual a partir de cierta edad y que, además, tenga otros tantos hábitos culturales como, por ejemplo, fumar, salidas nocturnas, frecuentar bares, etc. ¿por qué una mujer no puede hacerlo? Recapitulando lo dicho, a partir de esta última estrofa, Storni introduce una nueva propuesta, haciendo uso de la ironía: luego de haber sugerido a los hombres que se purificaran, y fueran entonces, tan castos y puros como a ella solicitaban, muestra con seguridad que no lo serán y, por lo tanto, tampoco tendrán autoridad para juzgarla. Es decir, esta poesía representa toda la lucha feminista que Alfonsina Storni realizó en su vida, buscando cambiar los estereotipos sexuales de su época, trasgrediendo el lenguaje y las costumbres esperadas para una mujer, dejando de lado la imagen de mujer-madre asexual para mostrar a una mujer plena, tan plena como puede serlo un hombre.

sVAtheistic Existentialism
p20971
VAfter Kierkegaard, existential thought was greatly expanded at the beginning of the 20th century by Heidegger and Jaspers (German philosophers), whose ideas in turn influenced a large number of European philosophers. An important feature of atheistic existentialism is the argument that existence precedes essence (the reverse of most traditional forms of philosophy) for it is held that man fashions his own existence and only exists by so doing, and, in that process, and by the choice of what he does or does not do, gives essence to that existence. Jean-Paul Sartre is the epitome of modern existentialism and his version, expressed through his novels, plays and philosophical writings, is the one that has caught on and been the most widely influential.

sVStrategy (or rhetorical strategy)
p21075
VThe management of language for a specific effect. The strategy or rhetorical strategy of a poem is the planned placing of elements to achieve an effect. For example, Shakespeare's sonnet 29, "When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes," spends the first nine lines describing the speaker's discontent, then three describing the happiness the thought of the loved-one brings, all in a single sentence. The effect of this contrast is to intensify the feelings of relief and joy in lines 10-12. The rhetorical strategy of most love poems is deployed to convince the loved-one to return the speaker's love. By appealing to the loved-one's sympathy ("If you don't return my love, my heart will break."), or by flattery ("How could I not love someone as beautiful as you?"), or by threat ("When you're old, you'll be sorry you refused me."), the lover attempts to persuade the loved-one to love in return.\u000a\u000aIf you don't tell me you love me now, I will die from heartache.

sV"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and lone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me." (Shelly 92)\u000a\u000aThe speaker's mention of Adam's perfection is appropriate to the development of his argument because... \u000a\u000aa. It starkly contrasts from the creature's character \u000ab. It starkly contrasts from Frankenstein's iniquity \u000ac. It shows that God only made Adam perfect while everyone else suffered \u000ad. It exalts God as the ultimate creator \u000ae. Frankenstein had hoped to create a perfect being
p22561
VThe creature uses Adam to compare himself to him and note his own likeness to Satan, perverted birth, and lack of intimate interaction. The creature did not actually exalt God, and his argument has to do with his suffering associated with his creation by Victor Frankenstein, not God. Frankenstein is not speaking.

sVWhat is Catch-22?

V(meaning "man of wrath" according to Homer, or more likely, from Greek "a guide; the one showing the way"), known as Ulysses in Roman mythology.

Odysseus was the son of Laertes and Anticlea, although some sources, prominent among them Iphigenia at Aulis by Euripides, state that Sisyphus was his father. As a child, Odysseus was wet-nursed by Euryclea. Odysseus was the king of Ithaca, husband of Penelope and father of Telemachus, favorite of Athena, and wiliest of the Greeks involved in the Trojan War. Odysseus earns this title by, among other things, masterminding the Trojan Horse. He is most famous for the ten years it took him to return home from the war, which is described in the Odyssey.

VThe Rime of the Ancient Mariner themes in Frankenstein: Coleridge's "Rime of the Ancient Mariner" tells the story of an ancient mariner who kills an albatross and brings upon himself and his ship's crew a curse. The ancient mariner travels the world, unburdening his soul, telling his story to whomever needs to hear it. Shelley alludes to the poem several times. Robert Walton in Frankenstein is similar to the Wedding Guest from "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," with Victor Frankenstein playing the role of the mariner. As the mariner feels compelled to share his story to one who needs to hear it, so does Victor. The explicit theme in "Rime of the Ancient Mariner," that love conquers all, is a clue as to how the tragedy that occurs in Frankenstein's life could have been avoided.

El conde tiene un criado que está considerando si debe casarse con una mujer que es rica pero también muy fuerte y brava. El conde pregunta al Patronio si el criado debe casarse con ella. Patronio responde con un ejemplo de una situación similar, la historia "de lo que aconteció a un mancebo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava." En otra villa había un mancebo muy bueno pero no rico que querría casarse con una mujer de estatus más alta. Nadie querría casarse con esta mujer porque ella era tan fuerte y brava. Esos característicos no eran aceptables para una mujer en la sociedad. Aun el padre de la mujer le dio advertencia de la maldad de su hija. Pero el novie tenía un plan para cambiar a la mujer y los dos se casaron. Inmediatamente después de entrar su nueva casa, el hombre mandó al perro que le trajera agua. Cuando el perro no respondió, lo mató el hombre violentamente. Dio la misma orden al gato y entonces el caballo, matando ambos después de que los dos no hicieron nada. Entonces él dio la misma orden a su esposa. Ella siguió la orden por miedo de lo que habría hecho el hombre loco si no siguiera las instrucciones. Entonces ella se convirtió en una mujer sumisa que siempre hacía lo que su esposo mandaba. Patronio sugiere que si el criado es como este hombre y sabe como controlar a su esposa, vale el matrimonio.

VAdapting a form of ironic false modesty in which a speaker claims ignorance regarding a question or philosophical problem.

When the "authority," presents an answer, the "modest" original speaker continues to ask pointed questions, eventually revealing the limitations or inadequacies of the supposed expert\u2014all the while protesting his or her own inferior knowledge. The irony comes from the speaker's continuing presentation of himself as stupid even as he demolishes inferior ideas others present to him. This is the method Socrates supposedly took regarding philosophical inquiry, and it is named socratic irony in his honor. (Porfiry Petrovich in Crime and Punishment)

sVSentence structure
p25819
Vwhen an essay question asks you to analyze sentence structure, look at the type of sentences the author uses. Remember that the basic sentence structures are simple, compound, and complex, and variations created with sentence combining. Also consider variation or lack of it in sentence length, any unusual devices in sentence construction, such as repetition or inverted word order, and any unusual word or phrase placement. As with all devices, be prepared to discuss the effect of the sentence structure. For example, a series of short, simple sentences or phrases can produce a feeling of speed and choppiness, which may suit the author's purpose.

Since its inception, nearly 18 million children have participated in the program.

VEurydice and Orpheus were young and in love. These young lovers were very happy and spent their time frolicking through the meadows. One day Eurydice was running through a meadow with Orpheus when she was bitten by a serpent. The poison of the sting killed her and she descended to Hades immediately. Orpheus was son of the great Olympian god Apollo. In many ways Apollo was the god of music and Orpheus was blessed with musical talents. Orpheus was so sad about the loss of his love that he composed music to express the emptiness. He was so desperate and found so little else meaningful, that he decided address Hades. As the overseer of the underworld, Hades heart had to be hard as steel, and so it was. But Orpheus' music was so sweet and so moving that it softened the steel hearted heart of Hades himself. Hades gave permission to Orpheus to bring Eurydice back to the surface of the earth to enjoy the light of day. There was only one condition--Orpheus was not to look back as he ascended. He was to trust that Eurydice was immediately behind him. It was a long way back up and just as Orpheus had almost finished that last part of the trek, he looked behind him to make sure Eurydice was still with him. At that very moment, she was snatched back because he did not trust that she was there.

sV"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and lone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me." (Shelly 92)\u000a\u000aThe reason for the shift in tone is due to .... \u000aa. The creature's reflection on his sad essence b. The creature's contempt for families \u000ac. The creature's fondness of books \u000ad. Frankenstein's guilt and separation from society \u000ae.Frankenstein's religiosity
p28259
V(A) Once the creature starts comparing himself to Adam, he switches his tone. He looks at himself as a descendant of Satan, abhorred and hopeless. He has no contempt for families, but he envies their love and wishes to have some of their happiness. The initial tone relates to his attraction to literature, but the second tone does not. Frankenstein is not speaking.

VA group of new ideas in literature, religion, culture, and philosophy that emerged in New England in the early to middle 19th century (1830-1860) and evolved into a predominantly literary expression. The adherents believed that knowledge could be arrived at not just through the senses, but through intuition and contemplation of the internal spirit. As such, they professed skepticism of all established religions, believing that Divinity resided in the individual, and the mediation of a church was cumbersome to achieving enlightenment. It represented a new way of understanding truth and knowledge. The roots of the philosophy go back to Germany, specifically the writings and theories of Immanuel Kant.

The opposing side, the Philistines, had a giant army man named Goliath on their side and challenged the Israelites to battle him. Because he was humongous, the Israelites were too scared to sacrifice one of themselves to fight, this went on for forty days. This completely changed when David decided to volunteer to fight Goliath. At first, the king and his older brothers did not want to let him even try but he convinced them that God would deliver him. When Goliath saw who the brave opponent was, he was angry because he was a little boy and he started making jokes about David. David used his slingshot to fire a stone at Goliath. The stone hit Goliath on the forehead and killed him. David was the hero of Israel and was the future king, chosen by God.

sVSam\u000a\u000aTheseus; mythical-founder king of Athens
p29291
VThis Greek/Roman mythology represents what one hero can do for the city. Theseus is a hero filled with wise knowledge and is one of the strongest heroes in mythology. His willingness to risk his life for the benefit of the people and cause violence is the creativity of humans in which they believe in chaos to resolve problems. \u000aAt the age of 16, Theseus proved his strength by lifting up a stone rock that was sent by his father. After proving to his mother; Princess Aethra his capability, he set forth to Athens to meet his father. Theseus enjoyed having adventures which makes him so unique. During his journey he killed victims by tearing them apart between two pine trees, killed Cercyon because he was making strangers wrestle, dispatching a boar, and many others. He was welcomed by all the citizens because he traveled on foot the whole journey and showed that he has the power to create a strong empire. Upon his arrival, his father Aegeus did not recognize who he was since he remarried and had more kids. Theseus was almost poisoned by his own father but proved that he was his son by showing a sword that he left him. His father realized the skills he has and was crowned king. Like in every mythological stories there is always a scary monster that eats people. Aegeus had sent King's Minos son; Androgeus on a mission to kill the Minotaur (half-bull and half-human). Sadly he was eaten and as revenge Minos told Aegeus to send tributes (7 men and 7 women) to the Minotaur. Theseus volunteered as a brave victim to kill Minotaur and would return to Athens with a white sail. His father warned Theseus that the monster had ate everyone who dared to kill him. Theseus, along with 13 others arrived at Crete; where one of the women falls in love with him and urges an architecture to keep him safe. He promises to marry her if he kills the Minotaur and so he does with his own bare hands. Returning to Athens legends say he abandoned Ariadne and others say he let her rest on an island. He forgets to rise up the white sail and his father believes he is dead so he jumps into the ocean. Theseus marries Ariadne's sister, Phaedra and they have a son together; Hippolytus. She falls in love with her own son but the son refuses to love her and she eventually kills herself and frames Hippolytus as a rapist.

Personification, on the other hand, is a broader term. It gives human attributes to abstract ideas, animate objects of nature or inanimate non-natural objects.For example, the sentence "The somber clouds darkened our mood" is a pathetic fallacy as human attributes are given to an inanimate object of nature reflecting a mood. But, "The sparrow talked to us" is a personification because the animate object of nature "sparrow" is given the human quality of "talking".

In the resulting figure of speech, we end up talking about how a color sounds, or how a smell looks. Some examples are when we say a musician hits a "blue note" while playing a sad song (mixing visual and auditory imagery), when we talk about a certain shade of color as a "cool green" (mixing tactile or thermal imagery with visual imagery).

Cortes used a lot of Euphemism in order to water down the situation that happened in the city.

Vliterally "comedy of professional players" (Italian). A genre of Italian theater that emerged at the end of the sixteenth century. Performance relied on the portrayal of stock characters\u2014some of which were derived from Roman comic types\u2014and the improvisation of action and dialogue from a basic plot outline. There are two categories of commedia characters: unmasked and masked. The unmasked roles include the young lovers (the young man described as the innamorato and the young woman described as the innamorata). The many masked roles can usually be divided into masters and servants. The masters include: the Capitano, a braggart soldier whose romantic and military exploits are often discredited, Pantalone, a middle-aged or elderly merchant fond of courting young women, and Dottore, a pedantic show-off who often played Pantalone's friend or rival. The servant characters are typically described as zanni. The most popular include: Arlecchino or Harlequin, Brighella, and Pulcinello.

sVLoose and Periodic Sentences
p33225
VIn The Elements of Style, William Strunk and E. B. White counsel that we should avoid "a succession of loose sentences." "This rule refers especially to loose sentences of a particular type: those consisting of two clauses, the second introduced by a conjunction or relative" (25). Here is part of the example the authors employ to illustrate the point:\u000a\u000a "The third concert of the subscription series was given last evening, and a large audience was in attendance. Mr. Edward Appleton was the soloist, and the Boston Symphony Orchestra furnished the instrumental music" (25).\u000a \u000aA periodic sentence, on the other hand, is one in which the most important matter arrives at the end. Strunk and White note, "The effectiveness of the periodic sentence arises from the prominence it gives to the main statement" (33). Here is one sentence they offer to exemplify the point:\u000a \u000a"With these hopes and in this belief I would urge you, laying aside all hindrance, thrusting away all private aims, to devote yourself unswervingly and unflinchingly to the vigorous and successful prosecution of this war" (33).

Hippolyta's girdle was a leather belt that was give to her as a gift from Ares and it served as Hippolyta's authority as queen. Hercules was given his next labor by Hera and king Eurystheus. He was to first find the Amazons and then bring back Hippolyta's girdle. The Amazons welcomed him in a great manner once Hercules had found them. Hercules told the Amazons that he would like to speak to Hippolyta and a few minutes later Hippolyta was at Hercules ship. Hippolyta gave her fancy belt to Hercules because she felt sorry when Hercules told her his sad story. Since, Hera was not pleased she dressed herself as an Amazon. Hera told the Amazons that Hercules had been deceived and wanted to kidnap the queen. The Amazons were furious so they quickly went to the ship of Hercules. In one version while Hercules was on his ship he saw the Amazons coming towards him so he killed Hippolyta in order to get the belt and because he thought she had betrayed him, but in another one Hippolyta was killed by the Amazons. Hercules and the Greeks fought with the Amazons and soon sailed away to give the belt to Eurystheus since he wanted it.

Vthe end of times, where evil will be defeated by Christ during his second coming, Originates from the Book of Revelation.

Armageddon is the time for the second coming of Christ will occur, as Jesus will come back in order to defeat the anti-christ, and the devil. A great war will occur. The world ruler the anit-christ is controlling the world and wreaking chaos everywhere but still answers to Satan. The third member of the unholy trinity is referred to as the " beast coming up out of the earth" (Revelation 13:11). As satan and the anti-christ are the main leaders of the world, the beast assists them by performing satanic miracles, and influencing people to worship the beast, and follow satan. As the world is controlled by Satan, the anti-christ and the beast. Working together to control man. As armies battle for a struggle of power throughout the Holy Land and attempting to sack Jerusalem. Christ appears with his army to defeat the other great armies influenced by Satan. The armies who are battling each other forget their differences and unite to battle Christ. As Christ defeats with what is quoted in the Their struggle against such an adversary, however, is useless. It is apparent that they are put to death not by ordinary military struggle, but by the word of authority proceeding out of His mouth described as "a sharp sword" (Revelation 19:15), the opposing army is put to death by one stroke after, as they take the beast, and the false prophet and thrown into the lake of fire burning with brimstone. Which leads to the end of satanic control. As Satan is thrown into the abyss for the entire reign of Christ for a thousand years. Then he is destined to join the beast and the false prophet in the lake of fire. (Revelation)

sVTheme: Insanity vs. Sanity
p33609
V-insanity is a very broad term with different clinical, legal, and colloquial connotations\u000a-it can be used to mean how an individual cannot learn from his or her mistakes\u000a-it can also mean that one cannot conform to society or is simply foolish\u000a-every definition of the word, however, pertains to some deficiency in one's relationship with oneself or the world\u000a-if a man cannot get along with people in the world because he does not operate by the same set of logical principles, moral precepts, or social graces that the society around him accepts, that society might consider him insane\u000a-in the world of Catch-22, however, not only are the rules of society different from those of a non-military society, they are different from tent to tent, from person to person\u000a-there seems to be no standard for logical thinking, no universal moral compass\u000a-therefore, the fact that the men often characterize each other as "crazy" is no surprise; everyone has a different set of rules, so to each man, everyone else is not following the rules\u000a-sanity serves man by making him competent to solve problems and survive in his environment by being able to interact positively in his circumstances\u000a-therefore, a man like Yossarian who fakes illness to stay in the hospital and takes wild evasive action on every mission to avoid danger is, by some standards, quite sane; he is a survivor\u000a-in this way, Doc Daneeka is correct when he declares Yossarian sane for not wanting to fly more missions\u000a-Technical definitions aside, however, the men use the word "crazy" to describe the world around them because war is unfamiliar, unnatural, and cruel\u000a-they are on some level reacting with incredulity to the fact that they must go about their daily lives dealing with death and danger\u000a-paranoia and extreme fits of anger usually mark a person who is unfit to get along in his surroundings, but calm nonchalance amidst destruction and death can be seen as disturbing or perverse behavior, too\u000a-the different ways the men find to reconcile this disparity informs their respective worldviews

Vwhen we feel justified in fighting one evil with another one.

It doesn't counter-act the crime, but it punishes the offender). The Two Wrongs fallacy sometimes seems plausible for another reason: to counter-act hypocrisy.

VShort Summary: This play is about an african american family who struggles with finances. They all are depending on the check that mama is going to receive. When the check gets there, Walter takes all of the money just to get it stolen. Beneatha, who was supposed to use half of the money for schooling, is devested and mama is in denial. Although all of the money is gone, the family is brought closer together.\u000a\u000aPersonal response: The play was a great representation of family sticking together when things go wrong. Through all of the circumstances the family did not break up; they grew stronger.\u000a\u000aThe"Perfect quote" from the novel:\u000aMama: "There is always something left to love. And if you ain't learned that, you ain't learned nothing"

What appears to be solid reason can manipulate you allegiances more easily than an emotional argument; therefore, be critical when you read.

sV"But Paradise Lost excited different and far deeper emotions. I read it, as I had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands, as a true history. It moved every feeling of wonder and awe, that the picture of an omnipotent God warring with his creatures was capable of exciting. I often referred the several situations, as their similarity struck me, to my own. Like Adam, I was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine in every other respect. He had come forth from the hands of God a perfect creature, happy and prosperous, guarded by the especial care of his Creator; he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature: but I was wretched, helpless, and lone. Many times I considered Satan as the fitter emblem of my condition; for often, like him, when I viewed the bliss of my protectors, the bitter gall of envy rose within me." (Shelly 92)\u000a\u000aThe authors contrasts Adam's ability to communicate and the speaker's bitterness towards his neighbors' interaction in order to... \u000a\u000aa. Show Frankenstein's misanthropy \u000ab. Show Frankenstein's desire to go back to the loving family life he once had \u000ac. Show that creations of god are better than those with likeness to Satan \u000ad. Show the creature's desire to associate with people \u000ae. Show the divinity and omnipotence of God
p36563
V(E) The author's purpose of this passage is to underline the differences in interaction with others and natures of the creature and of Adam because of their contrasting creators. Shelley is not focusing on Frankenstein in this passage and has no religious lesson to teach. The creature is jealous of Adam and all people that can love and communicate with each other; he does not necessarily hate them. His true misanthropy begins after he is shunned by DeLacey's family and this passage precedes that event.

Also - the idea that the opposite of the idea exists because of the idea or even the future idea. LOL.

Moses led them across the Red Sea, which parted, and into the desert, where they roamed for many years. He went up to Mount Sinai, where God gave him the Ten Commandments. He was gone a long time and the people started to get nervous, so they built an idol to worship: a golden calf. When Moses came and found them worshipping an idol, he was so upset that he broke the tablets the commandments were on. After they destroyed the calf, he went back and got another copy of the commandments.

VTo be "sold down the river" means the person is of no use any more or isn't wanted. There is a betrayal between the person being "sold" and the person who did the selling. The betrayal is done by someone who is often trusted by the person who was betrayed. \u000aEarliest source found: The Ohio Repository, May 1837\u000aUsed in the South when landowners would sell their servants.\u000aDuring the time of slavery, wealthy southern landowners would would sell their servants to be slaves to other plantation owners. The servants would be "sold down the river" more specifically down the Mississippi River. Being a servant then downgrading to a slave is was the ultimate form of betrayal between the landowner and their servant. The life of a servant was slightly better than that of a slave and most of the time men were the ones being sold. Not only were the servants going to be separated from their families but they were being sent to their "death sentence" since in plantations all they would do if hard labor.

En estas cartas, Cortés describe su viaje a México, su llegada a Tenochtitlán, capital del imperio azteca, y algunos de los eventos que resultarían en la conquista de México. Hernán Cortés era de linaje noble y estudió durante algún tiempo latín, gramática y leyes en la Universidad de Salamanca, aunque sin graduarse, obtuvo los conocimientos y habilidades necesarias de buen escritor, sus cartas tienen verdadero valor literario e histórico, pues las descripciones en ellas plasmadas figuran en primer término de las crónicas de la conquista del Imperio Azteca.\u000a Así como otros españoles que describieron la gran ciudad de Tenochtitlán, Cortés describe éste lugar con un tono de asombro y de maravilla: La ubicación de la ciudad en medio de un lago rodeado de montañas, la arquitectura espléndida, y evidentemente la riqueza material.

But to their surprise, he only stayed their till the middle of the night. He tore the doors to the city gate and carried them to the top of a hill. Later on at the Valley of Sorek, he falls in love with a woman named Delilah. The ruler of the Philistines became aware of this and told Delilah if she can lure him into telling her the secret behind his strength and in return she would receive eleven hundred shekels of silver. Delilah asked Samson what is the secret of his strength and how can he come week, he responded that if he is tied with seven fresh bowstrings he would become weak. She did so and screamed, "The Philistines are upon you!" But he broke loose, and after two more fails he told her the truth. "No razor has ever been used on my head," he said "because I have been a Nazirite dedicated to God from my mother's womb. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as any other man." Delilah told the ruler of the Philistines his secret who then shaved off the seven braids of his hair. They gouged his eyes, and took him to prison. His brothers and family went down to get him and buried him in his father's tomb, Manoah.\u000a\u000aSamson's hair represents spiritual power that grows from the conscious, while Delilah represents thoughts and emotions. Although emotions play a big part in our process of making a decision, we should not let our emotions rule our decision because those emotions get the best of us which leads us to making the wrong decisions instead of listening to our conscious and what is right

King Midas' guards presented him to the King who warmly welcomed him into his home. Silenus started to entertain them all with wonderful stories. Since the king committed a warm act towards this drunk man, God Dionysus granted him a wish with no exceptions to it. The king was very greedy therefore he wished for everything that he touched to turn to gold. His wish was eventually granted. His bed, food, water, and even his daughter turned into gold. He realized that he would soon turn his whole kingdom into gold so he had to retract the wish as soon as he could. Because of his previous good acts, Dionysus actually did retract the wish. After this, King Midas was poorer than he had ever been before, however he realized that being poor was much better than not having his daughter. He changed his ways and became a compassionate man who would never again take his family in return for his greed. After becoming this different person he lived on an incredible life that cared about what was truly valuable.

sVstyle -
p42929
V- The consideration of style has two purposes: (1) An evaluation of the sum of the choices an author makes in blending diction, syntax, figurative language, and other literary devices. Some authors' styles are so idiosyncratic that we can quickly recognize works by the same author (or a writer emulating that author's style). Compare, for example, Jonathan Swift to George Orwell or William Faulkner to Ernest Hemingway. We can analyze and describe an author's personal style and make judgments on how appropriate it is to the author's purpose. Styles can be called flowery, explicit, succinct, rambling, bombastic, commonplace, incisive, or laconic, to name only a few examples. (2) Classification of authors to a group and comparison of an author to similar authors. By means of such classification and comparison, we can see how an author's style reflects and helps to define a historical period, such as the Renaissance or the Victorian period, or a literary movement, such as the romantic, transcendental or realist movement.

sVTheme: Power of Bureaucracy/Big Institutions, Rankings
p43521
V-the lives and deaths of the men in Yossarian's squadron are governed not by their own decisions concerning dangerous risks but by the decisions of an impersonal, frightening bureaucracy\u000a-the men must risk their lives even when they know that their missions are useless, as when they are forced to keep flying combat missions late in the novel after they learn that the Allies have essentially won the war\u000a-the bureaucrats are absolutely deaf to any attempts that the men make to reason with them logically; they defy logic at every turn\u000a-for example, Major Major will see people in his office only when he is not there\u000a-another example, Doc Daneeka won't ground Yossarian for insanity because Yossarian's desire to be grounded reveals that he must be sane\u000a-several scenes of interrogation add to the bureaucracy's frustrating refusal to listen to reason \u000a-in one such scene, Scheisskopf interrogates Clevinger but will not let Clevinger state his innocence because he is too busy correcting Clevinger's way of speaking\u000a-in another such scene, the chaplain is taken into a cellar and accused of a crime, but the men interrogating him do not know what the crime is - they hope to find out by interrogating him\u000a-in these and other instances, Yossarian's companions learn that what they do and say has very little effect on what happens to them\u000a-all they can do is learn to navigate their way through the bureaucracy, using its illogical rules to their own advantage whenever possible\u000a-the ranking in this book is taken very seriously, because if you are ranked higher than somebody else, you are their superior and they are forced to listen to you\u000a-this can be seen with how when General Peckem finally gained control, but as soon as Scheisskopf got a higher rank, he lost all power and authority\u000a-Major Major, another example, outranks Scheisskopf and the latter is very confused about to act towards him\u000a-however, some characters in the novel figured out that the officers only have ranks and powers with their uniforms on\u000a-to represent this, Dunbar, Dobbs, and Hungry Joe threw the officer's uniforms out of the window and this got rid of rank symbolically\u000a-demonstrates that humans don't have rank without them\u000a-Heller goes to great lengths to point out the incompetence, pettiness, and corruption within the bureaucratic ranks\u000a-its officers are often blindly selfish, heartless, indecisive, deeply insecure, and wildly ambitious\u000a-they have no compassion for human life or any sort of morality\u000a-they answer only to those with more money and more power\u000a-accountability is often in question\u000a-the bureaucrats have no problem cutting corrupt deals with troublesome individuals to get rid of them, or sometimes just discreetly eliminating them\u000a-According to Heller, such a bureaucracy is the product of a modern capitalistic society

VSUMMARY: A stone wall separates the speaker's property from his neighbor's. In spring, the two meet to walk the wall and jointly make repairs. The speaker sees no reason for the wall to be kept\u2014there are no cows to be contained, just apple and pine trees. He does not believe in walls for the sake of walls. The neighbor resorts to an old adage: "Good fences make good neighbors." The speaker remains unconvinced and mischievously presses the neighbor to look beyond the old-fashioned folly of such reasoning. His neighbor will not be swayed. The speaker envisions his neighbor as a holdover from a justifiably outmoded era, a living example of a dark-age mentality. But the neighbor simply repeats the adage.\u000aTHEME: isolation, communication

V________, German word meaning "look-alike" or "double walker", originally meant a ghost or shadow of a person but nowadays it simply refers to a person that is a look-alike of another person. In literature, _________ is usually shaped as a twin, shadow or a mirror image of a protagonist. It refers to a character who physically resembles the protagonist and may have the same name as well. Several types of _______ can be spotted in world literature. It may take the form of an "evil twin", not known to the actual person, who confuses people related to that original person. Besides, it may be figured as one person existing in two different places at the same time. Sometimes, a ________ is a person's past or future self. In some cases, it may simply be a person's look alike.

VRefined by the theorist Hegel (Hegelian Dialectic "hay-gale-ian"), thesis+antithesis=synthesis. There are three dialectical stages of development (of a phenomenon or structure in society): a thesis, giving rise to its reaction, an antithesis, which contradicts or negates the thesis, and the tension between the two being resolved by means of a synthesis. Ex. In Capitalism: The needs of the workers for fair pay (thesis) are in conflict with the needs of the elite owners to make a profit (antithesis), this conflict creates a resolution where the Government creates a mandatory minimum wage (synthesis), which then becomes the new thesis (dialectical structures exist in a chain).

VJesus was accused of blasphemy by both the Jewish high priests and elders of Sanhedrin, arriving at the decision to put him to death. Jesus was taken to Pontius Pilate which was the Roman governor of Judea to agree to put Jesus to death. Pilate found him innocent, but when the Jewish priests were asked they said "Crucify him!" Before his crucifixion Jesus was stripped naked, beaten with a whip, and a crown of thorns was placed in his head. Since Jesus was unable to carry his own cross, Simone of Cyrene was forced to carry it. Jesus was led to Goloha where he would be crucified. He was fastened to the cross by nails that were driven into his wrists and ankles. It took 6 hours for Jesus to die and in those hours people passed by shouting insults at him and scoffing. Christ's body was placed in tomb where a large stone covered the entrance and soldiers guarded the tomb. Several women(including Mary and others) on a Sunday went to anoint the body of Jesus. At that moment an earthquake happened and an angel from heaven rolled back the stone. The angels informed the women that Jesus has "risen" and told them to enter the tomb to see for themselves. The angel then told the women to go tell the disciples and they did so, but Jesus made another appearance and said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go tell my brothers to go to Galilee. There they will see me." Not only did Jesus appear here but also twice when disciples were in prayer and also to the disciples that were fishing in Sea of Galilee. Overall, Jesus made 12 appearances, but this is one of them.

Occasionally, however, parodies take on a life of their own and don't require knowledge of the original.

sVPoint of view
p45335
VIn literature, the perspective from which a story is told. There are two general divisions of ___________________, and many subdivisions within those. (1) the first person narrator tells the story with the first person pronoun, "I," and is a character in the story. This narrator can be the protagonist, a participant (character in a secondary role), or an observer (a character who merely watches the action). 2) the third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: omniscient and limited omniscient. In the "third person omniscient" point of view, the narrator, with godlike knowledge., present the thoughts and actions of any or all characters. This all-knowing narrator can reveal what each character feels and thinks at any given moment. The "third person limited omniscient" point of view, as its name implies, presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all remaining characters. This definition applies in question in the multiple-choice section. However on the essay portion of the exam, the "point of view" carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude.

Para el padre, el hijo ya no es su hijo porque ha maldecido la sangre por su delincuencia (él es un criminal: ha matado y ha robado).

VRosa Montero: Una persona sale a la calle a combatir casi literalmente contra el tráfico y la congestión.

La narradora aborrece, odia e insulta a todos los que junto a ella compiten por unos metros de asfalto= calle. Sólo cuando logra aparcarse en un lugar, gracias a la generosidad de un hombre de mediana edad, la narradora demuestra cualidades humanas positivas como la bondad y el agradecimiento. El hombre, tan abrumado y ansioso como la narradora, se sorprende por la muestra de agradecimiento en este ambiente hostil. Son incapaces de comportarse o comunicarse cordialmente. Irónicamente, la narradora crítica la misma insensibilidad que ella había demostrado hasta ese momento.

VA distinct classification in literature. From the Lat., "genus:" "type, kind;" pron. "Zhawn-reh."

By correctly identifying the genre of a text, we can get a better idea of its author's intention and purpose. We can also deepen our sense of the value of any single text, by allowing us to view it comparatively, alongside other texts of the same type. In ancient Greece and Rome the primary genres were: epic; lyric (ode and ballad); drama (tragedy and comedy) and satire. Today the novel and short story have been added to those major classical genres, as well as numerous minor categories. The literary genres used by the College Board in their AP study guides are the following: autobiography and diary; biography and history; criticism; drama; essay and fiction (novel and short story); expository prose; journalism; political writing; science and nature writing.

VAutor: Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XIX\u000aTema: Tiempo y espacio: Tema y técnica\u000aResumen: En este poema, se hacen presentes todas las características del romanticismo. El enamorado recurre con desesperación, celos, tristeza y angustia al recuerdo del amor perdido; nada en el mundo es suficiente para describir su desolación. Las golondrinas, las madreselvas, las ardientes palabras de amor--todo puede renacer, excepto el amor perdido y la fatalidad que hará imposible el reencuentro. Solo le queda el hedonista consuelo de estar seguro de que nadie conseguirá amar como él ha sido capaz.

VThe novela tells the story of the local Catholic Priest (Don Manuel) in fictional Valverde de Lucerna, Spain as told through the eyes of Angela, one of the townspeople. Throughout the course of the story Manuel is adored by the people of the town. He is constantly in the service of the townspeople. He refrains from condemning anyone and goes out of his way to help those whom the people have marginalized. Instead of refusing to allow the holy burial of someone who committed suicide, don Manuel explains that he is sure that in the last moment, the person would have repented for their sin. Also, instead of excommunicating a woman who had an illegitimate child, as the Catholic Church would have done, don Manuel arranges a marriage between the woman and her ex-boyfriend, so that order will return to the town, and the child will have a father figure. The people of the town consider him their "Saint" because of all of the good deeds he does.\u000a\u000aAngela, after a brief stint away for education, returns to the town to live with her mother where she continues to be amazed at Manuel's devotion.\u000a\u000aLater, Lazarus, Angela's brother returns from the New World, disgusted with the mental and physical poverty he finds in the town. He too is amazed at Manuel's devotion but believes that "He is too intelligent to believe everything he teaches." It is clear that Lazarus does not have a sense of faith. Angela's and Lazarus's mother passes away. On her death bed she makes Lazarus promise to pray for her\u2014he swears he will. Her dying wish is that Manuel can convert him. Lazarus begins following don Manuel "to the lake" where Manuel is known to walk and think. Time passes and Lazarus takes Communion\u2014to the townspeople, he appears to be converted. In reality, Lazarus is only praying for his mother's sake because it was her wish, not because he has faith.\u000a\u000aImmediately following the Communion, Lazarus sits down with Angela and tells her that he has something he must tell her: Both Manuel and Lazarus have no faith in God, specifically no belief in an after-life. Angela is upset and incredulous but confronts Manuel about what Lazarus has said. In their conversation it becomes obvious that what Lazarus has said is accurate. Manuel believes that religion and the preaching of religion is the only way for the people to live contentedly\u2014Lazarus through their talks had come to admire Manuel's determination to do what he thought was right despite his lack of belief in the veracity of what he taught. To that end, Lazarus felt it best to continue in the same way by returning to the fold. Although Angela questions the goodness of such a deed, Lazarus insists that don Manuel is a saint for the things he has done all his life for the town.\u000a\u000aManuel grows increasingly weak. He is unable to bear the weight of teaching the resurrection when he does not believe it is real. He falls further and further into a depression, the towns people see this as a reflection of Christ in their local priest. When Manuel dies he chooses to do so in public in the center of the town, and the people see him as their "second Christ." Lazarus takes on Manuel's role until his own death. Angela moves out of town. She finishes her narration by explaining that Manuel is being considered for beatification and that he is being held up as the ideal and exemplar priest.

Eso ya no me importa. con tal que se vaya lejos, donde ya no vuelva a saber de usted. con tal de eso porque para mi usted, ya no es mi hijo. he maldecido la sangre que usted tiene de mi. La parte que a mi me tocaba la he maldecido., He dicho : ! que se le pudra en los riñones la sangre que le di!, lo dije desde que supe que usted andaba trajinando por los caminos, viviendo del robo y matando gente... y gente buena". El hecho de querer salvar al hijo es sólo el cumplimiento del deber por parte del padre, el hijo no recibe palabras de alivio ni de consuelo o solidaridad, el padre no siente pena por el hijo moribundo, siente la desesperación de quien ha perdido la esperanza de recobrar al hijo amado. El padre de Ignacio cumple con la obligación que siente hacia quien fue su mujer y así se lo dice al hijo. se percibe el dolor del padre de ese hijo delincuente que pronuncia las palabras llevado por el dolor y la rabia. No Oyes ladrar los perros, cuento realista de Rulfo que nos presenta al hijo que necesita del amor y apoyo del padre pero tambien al padre que ha llegado al límite de la desesperanza y la inminente muerte del hijo lo conduele.

VAutor: Miguel de Unamuno\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XX\u000aTema: La dualidad del ser y el enigma de la existencia\u000aResumen: Ángela Carbanillo es una joven de Lucerna de Valverde, que hasta que cumplió los quince años estudió en un colegio de monjas pagado por su hermano, Lázaro. Cuando dejó de estudiar volvió a su pueblo, donde se encuentra con sus amigos, familiares, vecinos y con un personaje muy conocido, el párroco Don Manuel. Cuando Ángela cumple veinticuatro años, su hermano Lázaro vuelve al pueblo para llevarse a ella y a su madre a la ciudad pero no las convence y decide quedarse. Con el transcurso del tiempo se crean controversias entre Lázaro y Don Manuel pero al demostrarse una gran amistad, estas casi desaparecen, aunque siguen manteniéndose algunas diferencias ya que Lázaro sabe, y a su vez Ángela sospecha, el secreto de Don Manuel. Antes de morir, Don Manuel le dice a Lázaro que su mayor deseo es que la gente tenga fe y, así, mantenga su esperanza; a pesar de que el no la tenga. Le dice que no se lo cuente a nadie porque rompería con las esperanzas de todo el pueblo y para Don Manuel, era tan importante creer en la vida como creer que hay algo después de la muerte. Pide que le lleven a la iglesia para realizar su última misa y poder despedirse de su pueblo. Tras su muerte, Lázaro lo va a visitar todos los días a su tumba. Lázaro en una conversación con su hermana le dice que él no puede creer en Dios, como Don Manuel, porque no tiene pruebas de su existencia. Ángela, después la muerte de su hermano, decide escribir todo lo que sabe, aunque ella lo escribe esperando que nadie lo lea y descubra el secreto de Don Manuel.

VNecessarily, being a "Mrs. Grundy" is not a good thing. If someone were to mention to me I would feel offended because I would be known as an individual that criticizes and only cares about myself. The literary character represents in general a person who can judge anything they see. This fictional character is well-known in literature and has been mentioned in many texts such as; Charles Dicken's Hard Times, Aimee Crocker's biography, P. T. Barnum's non-fiction booklet, and more.\u000aShe is a fictional character that represents someone very critical in society. She appears in a short play called. "Speed the Plow" by Thomas Morton as a minor character. \u000a In this story she plays the role of a farmer's wife in the year of 1798. As confusing as this sounds, she doesn't come out in the play, she is only mentioned. For example, during the play one of the characters mentions to the farmer "What will Mrs. Grundy say?" Although she never appears on stage she represents someone who judges everything they see. The name comes from the word grundyism and is defined as, a prudish adherence to conventionality, especially in personal behavior.

Por ejemplo, eran testigos del ciclo delo sol y la noche que lo describieron como una maravilla. Las imágenas del fuego destruyendo sus templos, los rayos, las olas, los cometas y la llorona fueron señales que asustaron los indígenas. Moctezuma ve en el cielo hombres armados en caballo representando los dioses. Entonces, cuando vienen los españoles piensan que son sus dioses y los mexicas son percibidos como vulnerables y temerosos. El pájaro es su mensajero muestro los conquistadores españoles por el espejo era la señal mayor que algo malo iba suceder al pueblo mexica. Estos sentimientos de sufrimiento son expresados en el poema elegiaco del nahua anónimo que reconce la pérdida de su pueblo a causa de la explotación de los españoles. \u000a\u000aConexión con otros textos: Hernán Cortés <<Segunda carta de relación>> en las perspectivas de colonización de salvando almas o la explotación de seres humanos. \u000a\u000aTemas y conceptos: Las sociedades en contacto- El imperialismo, La dualidad del ser- La espiritualidad y la religión

VUsually refers to the work of seventeenth-century poets who used similar methods and revolted against the romantic conventionalism of Elizabethan love poetry. They tended toward psychological analysis of the emotions of love and religion. They had a penchant for the unusual and shocking, used metaphysical conceits. They intended to express honestly, yet unconventionally, the poet's sense of the complexities and contradictions of life. (John Donne, George Herbert) The diction is simple as compared with that of the Elizabethan or Neo-Classic Periods, and echoes the words and cadences of common speech. The imagery is drawn from the commonplace or the remote. The form is frequently that of an argument with the poet's lover, with God, or with himself.

In the story Lord Marmion is trying to win over a women which is already involved with someone else ; where the issues already begin. Marmion then accuses the woman's other suitor Sir Wilton of treason in order to get rid of him. Sir Wilton then leaves the country in order to escape accusations but, Marmion leaves to fight to battle then dies.Wilton is then able to return and marry the woman anyway. The lies Marmion told were for nothing in the end he did not get what he wanted. The more destructive the lie the harder it was to maintain thus creating a more complicated predicament.

p49763
VAutor: Don Juan Manuel\u000aÉpoca: Siglo XIV\u000aTema: La construcción del género: Machismo y feminismo\u000aResumen: La historia empieza con el conde Lucanor presentando un problema a Patronio y solicitando consejo para resolverlo. El conde tiene un criado que está considerando si debe casarse con una mujer que es rica pero también muy fuerte y brava. El conde pregunta al Patronio si el criado debe casarse con ella. Patronio responde con un ejemplo de una situación similar, la historia "de lo que aconteció a un mancebo que casó con una mujer muy fuerte y muy brava." En otra villa había un mancebo muy bueno pero no rico que querría casarse con una mujer de estatus más alta. Nadie querría casarse con esta mujer porque ella era tan fuerte y brava. Esos característicos no eran aceptables para una mujer en la sociedad. Aun el padre de la mujer le dio advertencia de la maldad de su hija. Pero el novie tenía un plan para cambiar a la mujer y los dos se casaron. Inmediatamente después de entrar su nueva casa, el hombre mandó al perro que le trajera agua. Cuando el perro no respondió, lo mató el hombre violentamente. Dio la misma orden al gato y entonces el caballo, matando ambos después de que los dos no hicieron nada. Entonces él dio la misma orden a su esposa. Ella siguió la orden por miedo de lo que habría hecho el hombre loco si no siguiera las instrucciones. Entonces ella se convirtió en una mujer sumisa que siempre hacía lo que su esposo mandaba. Patronio sugiere que si el criado es como este hombre y sabe como controlar a su esposa, vale el matrimonio.

p50605
VSUMMARY: The speaker begins with a weird metaphor of an old man dying. He says that the parting between him and his wife should be like the gentle death of an old man\u2014you can't even tell when he's stopped breathing. Then he shifts gears and compares shallow love to earthquakes that make a big scene and cause a big fuss, but don't have tremendous lasting effects. On the contrary, his love is like the unnoticed, subtle movements of the stars and planets that control the fates of every person (well, according to popular belief). That super-handsy couple can't stand to be apart because their love is based solely on physical contact, but the love he has can stretch any distance because the pair share one soul. But he says that he and his wife are like a compass when drawing a circle. One foot of the compass (Donne) goes way out and travels around, while the other (his wife) stays planted at home and leans after it. But those two compass feet are part of one unit and will always end up back together. \u000aTHEME: love, lust, loyalty

The breaking of bread and sharing of wine serves as a sense of communion Jesus's blood being spilled represents the love he had for his people.\u000aNew Testament, Matthew 26: 17-30\u000aThe Last Supper or "The Lord's Supper" is said to be the last meal Jesus Christ had with his apostles right before his crucifixion. Jesus was being tracked down by the Romans and was going to be arrested even though he was sinless. Despite the little time he had left, Jesus planned for his twelve disciples to have dinner with him. In this dinner, Jesus predicted that his apostle Peter would deny knowing him three times before the rooster crowed that morning and that one disciple, Judas Iscariot, would betray him. This very meal Jesus Christ created the basis of the Eucharist. He does this by taking the bread at the meal and breaking it into pieces and giving it to his apostles saying " This is my body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me" and with the wine he said " This wine is the token of God's new covenant to save you- an agreement sealed with blood I will pour out for you." Following the supper Jesus Christ was arrested by the authorities and crucified on a wooden cross for all to see.

sVCLIMAX
p50985
VThe decisive moment and the turning point of the action in the plot of a play or story. This is the crucial part of the drama, the part which determines the outcome of the conflict. In Shakespeare's Julius Caesar the climax occurs at the end of Marc Antony's speech to the Roman public. The climax represents the point of greatest tension or the breaking point. In Othello the climax occurs when Othello realizes his wife's innocence and what a horrible thing he's just done. Sometimes the point of climax is a matter of debate. For example, in Hamlet some think it occurs when Hamlet confirms that Claudius was his father's killer in Act 3, Sc. 2. Others think it occurs when he stabs Polonius in Act 3, Sc. 4. Still others say that it occurs when he finally kills Claudius, near the end of the play in Act 5, Sc. 2. What do you think?

In all, some 200,000 people marched to Lincoln Memorial, where King delivered his famous "I Have A Dream" speech. The procession gave a new and fresh impetus to the growing civil rights movement and showed the government that action was needed quickly.

VUsed in love poetry, exploits a particular set of images for comparisons with the despairing lover and his unpitying but idolized mistress. For instance, the lover is a ship on a stormy sea, and his mistress 'a cloud of dark disdain'; or else the lady is a sun whose beauty and virtue shine on her lover from a distance.\u000a \u000a"The paradoxical pain and pleasure of lovesickness is often described using oxymoron, for instance uniting peace and war, burning and freezing, and so forth. But images which were novel in the sonnets of Petrarch became cliche\u0301s in the poetry of later imitators. Romeo uses hackneyed Petrarchan conceits in describing his love for Rosaline as 'bright smoke, cold fire, sick health'; and Shakespeare parodies such conceits in Sonnet 130: 'My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun."

(2) third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: a. third person omniscient, in which the narrator, with godlike knowledge, presents the thoughts and actions of any or all characters b. third person limited omniscient, in which the narrator presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all the remaining characters. In addition, be aware that the term point of view carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude.

p52947
VThe sensory details or figurative language used to describe, arouse emotion, or represent abstractions. On a physical level, imagery uses terms related to the five senses; we refer to visual, auditory, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory imagery. On a broader and deeper level, however, one image can represent more than one thing. For example, a rose may present visual imagery while also representing the color in a woman's cheeks and/or symbolizing some degree of perfection (It is the highest flower on the Great Chain of Being). An author may use complex imagery while simultaneously employing other figures of speech, especially metaphor and simile. In addition, this term can apply to the total of all the images in a work. On the AP exam, pay attention to how an author creates imagery and to the effect of this imagery.

sVrhetorical modes -
p53755
V- This flexible term describes the variety, the conventions, and the purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes and their purposes are as follows: (1) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP language exam essay questions are frequently expository topics. (2) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having an additional aim of urging some form of action. (3) The purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event, or action so that the reader can picture that being described. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straightforward and objective or highly emotional and subjective. (4) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. These four writing modes are sometimes referred to as modes of discourse.

p54087
VSatire is a manner of writing that mixes a critical attitude with wit and humor in an effort to improve mankind and human institutions. Ridicule, irony, exaggeration, and several other techniques are almost always present. The satirist's goal is to point out the hypocrisy of his target in the hope that either the target or the audience will return to a genuine following of the moral code. Thus, satire is inescapably moral even when no explicit values are promoted in the work, for the satirist works within the framework of a widely spread value system

Character can also refer to the particular, unique traits of a person in a literary work. CHARACTERIZATION is the way in which an author presents and defines characters. A "flat character" is one who is stereotypical and lacks interest. A "round character" is one who is presented in greater depth, interest and detail. A character who does not undergo any change is called a "static character" (e.g., Tiny Tim in Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol), while a character who undergoes some sort of trans-formation is called a "dynamic character" (e.g., Scrooge in the same work).

sVpoint of view --
p54811
VIn literature, the perspective from which a story is told. There are two general divisions of point of view and many subdivisions within those. (1) the first person narrator tells the story with the first person pronoun, "I," and is a character in the story. This narrator can be the protagonist, a participant (character in a secondary role), or an observer (a character who merely watches the action). (2) the third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: omniscient and limited omniscient. In the "third person omniscient" point of view, the narrator, with godlike knowledge, presents the thoughts and actions of any or all characters. This all-knowing narrator can reveal what each character feels and thinks at any given moment. The "third person limited omniscient" point of view, as its name implies, presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all remaining characters. This definition applies in questions in the multiple-choice section. However, on the essay portion of the exam, the "point of view" carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude. [For a thorough discussion of point of view, see Story and Structure, the text used by the seniors. In fact, you would be wise to get a copy of it from the thrift store because the introductory sections are wonderful discussions of how literature works.]

VSUMMARY: Prufrock seems to be addressing a potential lover, with whom he would like to "force the moment to its crisis" by somehow consummating their relationship. But Prufrock knows too much of life to "dare" an approach to the woman: In his mind he hears the comments others make about his inadequacies, and he chides himself for "presuming" emotional interaction could be possible at all. The poem moves from a series of fairly concrete (for Eliot) physical settings\u2014a cityscape and several interiors\u2014to a series of vague ocean images conveying Prufrock's emotional distance from the world as he comes to recognize his second-rate status ("I am not Prince Hamlet').\u000aTHEME: love, manipulation, appearances

They will use one foot (spondee or pyrrhic) that is different from the prevailing one.\u000a2. They will use a truncated or catalectic foot\u2014one in which a pause is substituted for an unaccented syllable. (break, break, break)\u000a3. They will use a feminine ending, in which two consecutive syllables of the rhyming words correspond with the accent on the first syllable: flying/dying \u000a4. They will use the caesura (also cesura), which is a "sense" pause in a line that does not affect the metrical count or timing. It is marked with double vertical lines (//). This method of variation is frequently found in blank verse. It is conducive to the run-on line as opposed to the end-stopped line. ("With loss of Eden, /till the greater Man (run-on) restore us./ and regain the blissful seat." (end-stopped)

sVCasandra Luna\u000aSolomon \u000aOld Testament
p56265
VThe story: \u000aSolomon a king of Israel and the son of David and is described as the third king of the United Monarchy, which would break apart into the northern Kingdom of Israel and the southern Kingdom of Judah shortly after his death. Following the split, his patrilineal descendants ruled over Judah alone. The Judgment of Solomon refers to a story from the Hebrew Bible in which King Solomon of Israel ruled between two women both claiming to be the mother of a child by tricking the parties into revealing their true feelings.Solomon wanted to find out which woman was the baby's mother. He had a wise plan. He asked for a sword. He told a servant to cut the baby in half. He would give half of the baby to each woman. Solomon would not really let the baby be cut in half. He wanted to see what the women would do. He knew the baby's mother would not let her son be hurt.One mother told Solomon not to cut the baby in half. She did not want the baby to be hurt. She loved the baby. She said the other woman could have him. The other woman told Solomon to cut the baby in half.Then Solomon knew who should keep the baby. The real mother did not want the baby to be hurt. Solomon gave the baby to her. Soon all the Israelites heard what had happened. They knew God had made Solomon wise.\u000aMeaning: \u000aThe meaning of the story of king Solomon is the true meaning behind leadership and love. Meanwhile, the people look up to their King, as the grand hero that they trust him enough to deal with grand situations as to decided what to do with an innocent baby. While, the story also portrays the meaning behind the true meaning behind a mother's true love. The mother would much rather have her son/daughter be with someone else than for their child to get hurt, much rather be dead. The love of a mother is so grand that the mother simply wants to protect her child, and love them.

The whole play takes place during the winter. The Lancasters and the New Yorks families have stopped battling thanks to Edward IV. Richard resents and loathes his brother's power and starts to kill people in order to become king. He manipulates a woman into marriage and becomes king after Edward dies. He then starts killing even more people, most importantly Edward's 2 sons since Richard is a temporary king and will be replaced by Edward's sons. He is still unhappy about his deformity (he was born with a hunchback) and has a terrible dream. The ghosts of all the people he had killed warn him of his death to come. Richmond, a French king and leader of the Lancasters, invades England and kills Richard. Richard accepts his death and Richmond becomes Henry VII. He unites the 2 families and peace settles between the land.

The indicative mood is used only for factual sentences. For example, "Joe eats too quickly." The subjunctive mood is used to express conditions contrary to fact. For example, "If I were you, I'd get another job." The imperative mood is used for commands. For example, "Shut the door!" The second meaning of mood is literary, meaning the prevailing atmosphere or emotional aura of a work. Setting, tone, and events can affect the mood. In this usage, mood is similar to tone and atmosphere.

VThe tragic conclusion of a story or play. The concluding action of a drama, especially a classical tragedy, following the climax and containing a resolution of the plot. For example, the catastrophe in Sophocles' play, Oedipus Rex, is the scene where Oedipus appears, just before his exile, and having just gouged out his eyes (as a way of punishing himself for what has happened). The point of catastrophe in a tragedy typically includes the death or moral destruction of the protagonist. The catastrophe in Shakespeare's tragedies always occurs in Act 5, and always includes the death of the protagonist. Consider the fates of Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, King Lear, and Othello.

Va. "The tragic hero is a man of noble stature. He is not an ordinary man but a man with outstanding quality and greatness about him" (Perrine).\u000ab. "The tragic hero is good, though not perfect" (Perrine) His fall is a result of hamartia.\u000ac. "The hero's downfall, therefore, is his own fault, the result of his own free choice--not the result of pure accident or villainy or some overriding malignant fate" (Perrine)\u000a \u000ad. "Nevertheless, the hero's misfortune is not wholly deserved. The punishment exceeds the crime. We do not come away from the tragedy with the feeling that 'He got what he had coming to him' but rather with the sad sense of a waste of human potential" (Perrine)\u000ae. "Yet the tragic fall is not pure loss. Though it may result in the protagonist's death, it involves, before his death, some increase in awareness, some gain in self-knowledge" (Perrine)

sVDENOUEMENT
p60031
VFrom the French: "unknotting" (pron.: "day-new-MAW'). The final outcome or unraveling of the main dramatic complications in a play, novel, or other work of literature. Denouement is usually the final scene or chapter in which any necessary, and, as yet unmade, clarifications are made. It sometimes involves an explanation of secrets or misunderstandings. In Hamlet, the denouement takes place after the catastrophe of Hamlet's death. The stage is littered with corpses. Prince Fortinbras makes an entrance and Horatio speaks his sweet lines in praise of Hamlet. His words bring relief and comfort: "Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest" (5.2). In the drama Othello, there is a plot to deceive Othello into believing that his wife, Desdemona, has been unfaithful to him. As a result of this plot, Othello kills his wife out of jealousy, the climax of the play. The denouement occurs soon after, when Emilia, who was Desdemona's mistress, proves to Othello that his wife was in fact honest, true, and faithful to him. Emilia reveals to Othello that her husband, Iago, had plotted against Desdemona and tricked Othello into believing that she had been unfaithful. Iago kills Emilia in front of Othello, and she dies telling Othello his wife was innocent. As a result of being mad with grief, Othello plunges a dagger into his own heart. Understanding the denouement helps the reader to see how the final end of a story unfolds, and how the structure of stories works to affect our emotions.

Merlin, who was Uther counselor, has the solution: he takes Uther's sword and with his magic, he runs it into a rock. The one man who is able to draw the sword from the stone again will be the rightful heir. Until one day Sir Ector and his sons Kay and Arthur (not knowing he is not Ector's real son but fostered by him) come to the place where the sword is captured in the rock, they come for a tournament. Arthur, being squirl to Ector and Kay, has to get Kay a new sword for his one is broken. He passes the rock and draws the sword, which he brings to Ector and Kay. Next, confusion is great, for how could this boy draw the sword from the stone. Then Merlin makes his entrance again and declares that Arthur is Uther's son. To proof that he places the sword back in the stone and dares anyone to draw it. Again no one succeeds, but Arthur. And so he became High King of Britain at a very young age.
