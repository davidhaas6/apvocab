VGénero: Literatura documental (crónica) \u000aSiglo: Época colonial (XVI)\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico: Hernán Cortés, "Segunda carta de relacion": This provides an excellent source for showing how the Spanish viewed the world and the people they had conquered. First off, Cortés sees everything from a European perspective. While he is impressed with the urban organization of Tenochtitlán, its bustling commercial life, and its hospitable people, he continues to view the "Indians" as barbarians and people without reason. What an excellent example of the "clash" of two cultures, which would eventually lead to war and decimation\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDestinatario: Al emperador Carlos V, rey de España; Propósito: Informarle del descubrimiento, describir la cultura y el paisaje y explicar su papel en la conquista. \u000a*Deja en claro que todo lo que descubre y conquista lo hace en nombre del rey. Cortés fue un renegado que desobedeció a su comandante y emprendió la conquista por su propia cuenta. Como soldado de Velásquez, este muy bien podría haber tomado responsabilidad de la conquista. \u000a*Los llama gente bárbara que no conoce a Dios y dice que son gente sin razón, a diferencia de los pueblos civilizados de Europa. La ironía es que antes había expresado su admiración por su cultura y había anotado las muchas semejanzas con el carácter de los europeos. También es un malagradecido, puesto que Moctezuma ha sido muy generoso con Cortés.

p1083
VThe dangerous fallacy that an argument or action is right simply and solely because a respected leader or source (a President, expert, one's parents, one's own "side," team or country, one's boss or commanding officers) says it is right. This is over-reliance on authority, a gravely corrupted argument from ethos that puts loyalty above truth, above one's own reason and above conscience. In this case a person attempts to justify incorrect, stupid or criminal behavior by whining "That's what I was told to do," or "I was just following orders." See also, "The Soldiers' Honor Fallacy." A not-uncommon but extreme example of this fallacy is the Big Brain/Little Brain Fallacy (also, the Fuhrerprinzip) in which a tyrannical cult-leader tells followers "Don't think with your little brains (the brain in your head), but with your BIG brain (the leader's)." This last is sometimes expressed in positive terms, i.e., "You don't have to worry and stress out about the moral rightness or wrongness of what you are doing since I, the leader. am assuming all responsibility for your actions. I will defend you and gladly accept all the consequences up to and including eternal damnation if I'm wrong." The opposite of this latter is the fallacy of "Plausible Deniability." See also, "Just Do It!"

VUsing an argument that the arguer himself or herself knows is not valid.

This latter is a common practice in American jurisprudence, and is sometimes portrayed as the worst face of "Sophism." [Special thanks to Bradley Steffens for pointing out this fallacy!] Included under this fallacy is the fallacy of Motivational Truth (also, Demagogy), deliberately lying to "the people" to motivate them toward some action the rhetor perceives to be desirable (using evil discursive means toward a good material end). A particularly bizarre and corrupt form of this latter fallacy is Self Deception (also, Whistling by the Graveyard). in which one deliberately and knowingly deludes oneself in order to achieve a goal, or perhaps simply in order to suppress anxiety and maintain one's energy level, enthusiasm, morale, peace of mind or sanity in moments of adversity.

sVLa Siesta del Martes; Gabriel Garcia Marquez
p1611
VGénero: Prosa- Cuento \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom -Realismo mágico\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aEl relato tiene de trasfondo la industria bananera de la costa norte de Colombia. Estas empresas eran conocidas por la explotación de sus trabajadores. Ese código de injusticia se ve repetido en muchos de los temas del relato. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aRepresentación feminista: Aunque "La siesta del martes" no contiene un mensaje feminista tan fuerte como "Dos palabras", sí pinta a una madre fuerte, digna y determinada que jamás critica o lucha por sus derechos como mujer y madre.\u000aRealismo: mientras que la mayoría de los autores del siglo XX experimentaron con la narración en prosa , no abandonaron por completo el realismo , como se ilustra en " ¿ No se oyes ladrar los perros ? " por Rulfo y" La siesta del martes " por García Márquez .\u000aRelaciones sociales e interpersonales: \u000aGarcía Márquez relata cómo la pobreza puede llevar a la gente a la delincuencia. Carlos roba por necesidad. Esto es un eco del padre y del padrastro de Lazarillo, quienes también robaban por necesidad. La completa objetividad del narrador de "La siesta del martes", que nos revela toda la triste realidad de la pobreza en Hispanoamérica y la indiferencia muchas veces de la iglesia y de la gente rica.\u000aVoz narrativa: Es completamente objetiva: cuenta sin comentar. Descripción detallista: La larga descripción al principio del camino que toma el tren por las fincas bananeras. \u2022 Pinta un cuadro muy completo y vivo. En García Márquez parece que siempre hay un subtexto oculto. \u000aSignos: \u000aSocio-económico:Viajan en un vagón de tercera clase. \u000aCarácter de la madre: su pujanza en insistir que el cura le deje ir al camposanto, su fortaleza, su dignidad \u000aCarácter del cura: su falta de piedad, su superficialidad, etc. \u000aAmbiente-Calor: es agobiante. Se menciona constantemente. \u000aCausa de la muerte: Realmente no sabemos 100% si Carlos fue a la casa de Rebeca para robar ya que el narrador no lo dice. Llovía mucho esa noche y llevaba una soga de cinturón y estaba descalzo. Si realmente fuera una ladrón quizá tuviera zapatos. \u000aSignificado de las últimas palabras de Carlos: "Ay, mi madre". Al saber que muere, recuerda a su madre y sabe lo que le va a pasar a su muerte y que ya no tendrá sostén. Carlos robaba para mantener a la familia. \u000aNi Rebeca ni el sacerdote muestra ningún remordimiento por el asesinato del ladrón ya que él es nada más que un ladrón y un pobre, una vida que no vale nada.

El padre, en lugar de crear una nueva realidad en la que escapar, en realidad alucina , que es una condición fisiológica. La muerte del hijo sirve como estímulo exterior para desencadenar una reacción psicosomática. \u000aEl amor de un padre: el amor incondicional a su hijo y mantiene una comunicación/relación abierta con él. \u000aEstado psíquico del padre:. Sabe que su hijo ha muerto. No grita oralmente, solo en su corazón. No quiere enfrentar la realidad. \u000aTragedia: El padre evita la tragedia por el deslizamiento en un estado alucinatorio. Le da tanto terror que no puede enfrentarlo. Le da alucinaciones, y sigue adelante como si su hijo estuviera vivo. \u000aNarrador: Omnisciente, siempre al lado del protagonista, contando todos sus sentimientos, pensamientos y acciones\u000aTiempo/Espacio: Es muy lento. Se dan las horas exactas/ Es muy denso: el calor de la selva tropical se menciona con frecuencia. La intensidad paralela la intensidad del sufrimiento del padre.\u000aPrefiguración: Al principio el padre teme que algo le pasa a su hijo: "¡Tan fácilmente una criatura calcula mal y sienta un pie en el vacío, y se pierde un hijo".\u000aPropósito/Moraleja: A pesar de los esfuerzos del padre de prevenir el peligro, el hijo muere. Moraleja: la idea que las cosas pasan y uno no las puede controlar, aunque intente hacerlo.

sVEl Burlador se sevilla y convidado de piedra; Gabriel Tellez (Tirso de molina)
p1935
VGénero: Teatro \u000aSiglo: XVII\u000aMovimiento: Comedia del Siglo de Oro (tres unidades)\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aDepiction of the role of women and the relationship between the sexes in Golden Age Spain. In order to seduce women, Don Juan must promise matrimony, because a woman during this period who had lost her virginity\u2014 albeit by no fault of her own\u2014was not eligible for marriage and had no alternative but to enter a convent. Don Juan's actions, therefore, destroy women's lives. And he has no compunction about dishonoring women, because he feels that his noble status and his superiority as a man gives him the privilege. Women have absolutely no voice in this period. They are pawns of men, and the king marries them off to whomever he wishes, without their consent. The play also has somewhat of a feminist theme, as two of the dishonored women, on their way to seek justice from the king, say "¡mal haya la mujer que en hombres fía!" \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl burlador de Sevilla es una obra religiosa en que Tirso expresa su postura frente al debate del acto de contrición que decía que si se confesaba sinceramente los pecados antes de morir, la salvación se aseguraba. Claramente, Tirso era de otra opinión. \u000aPrimera Jornada: Trama y desenlace \u2192 Don Juan ha deshonrado a Isabela. Si el duque se entera que Isabela no es pura, no querrá casarse con ella, pero el único modo de recobrar su honra es el matrimonio. \u000aNoción hacia las mujeres: Que las mujeres son inconstantes, débiles. (En los versos 155-56 también dice que las mujeres son inconstantes). \u000aIronía dramática: Tisbea dice que a ella no le afecta el amor como a otras chicas; desdeña a los hombres. Sin embargo, se enamora enseguida de don Juan. \u000aOposición fónica: "Aliento y tormento"---> Riman en consonancia, y cada palabra tiene un sentido diferente; "aliento", por ejemplo, es "respiración" y también "esfuerzo y valor". O sea, para una persona que apenas respira, don Juan tiene mucho valor y es muy atrevido. \u2022 Además de tempestad, significa "angustia". \u2022 Don Juan llega frío del mar (casi muerto), pero sus palabras de amor son muy ardientes. \u2022 Don Juan hace el amor ("fuego"), pero luego se huye sin cumplir su promesa ("frío"). \u000aJornada Segunda : \u000aMatrimonio forzado del duque Octavio y Ana: No puede negarse al deseo del rey. También, no le importa con quién se case mientras sea una 'buena pieza'. \u000aDiscurso religioso: Don Diego die que Dios lo va a castigar a don Juan por sus delitos. \u2022 "Tan largo me lo fiáis". (Queda mucho hasta la muerte). \u2022 Lo repite a lo largo del drama. Don Juan cree que como es joven, no va a morir pronto y tiene tiempo para enmendarse. Los pecados: No obedecer a su padre; aprovechase de su rango social; engañar a las mujeres; mentir, prometiéndoles matrimonio sabiendo que lo que hace las destruye; infringe las leyes de la amistad; mata a don Gonzalo; etc. \u000aJornada tercera: \u000aCena con don Gonzalo: Le dan de cenar culebras y alacranes. Cantan una canción con referencia a los errores de don Juan, y este por primera vez siente miedo. Don Gonzalo le toma por la mano y don Juan siente que se abrasa y pide confesión, pero es demasiado tarde. Don Juan se abrasa en el infierno. \u000aPetición de don Juan antes de morir: \u000aPide confesión y absolución pero es demasiado tarde; nunca en vida intentó remediarse. "Es justicia de Dios: quien tal hace que tal pague". \u000aLa muerte de don Juan resuelve muchos problemas para el rey ya que ahora puede casarse Mota con Ana y Octavio con Isabela.

Las historias muestran la diversidad de los Estados Unidos y sus grupos minoritarios marginados y, a menudo explotados : la difícil la vida de los trabajadores migrantes que trabajan de sol a sol , son mal pagados , y cuyos hijos deben ayudar en los campos , negándoles una educación. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl odio y el coraje del hijo mayor se debe a la muerte de sus tíos, la enfermedad de su padre, el mucho y difícil trabajo, etc. \u2022 Maldice a Dios; se queja de su mala fortuna; no entiende por qué su familia, que es tan buena, sufre tanto. \u000aLa familia: Es una familia muy unida que muestra mucho amor y cariño para con sus miembros. \u000aLa relación con Dios del hijo mayor: Es conflictiva. No cree que Dios se preocupa por ellos. No duda totalmente en su existencia. Es creyente; solo está frustrado que Dios no los ampara aunque son buena gente\u000aTítulo: El hijo dice que el único descanso para ellos es la muerte, y la madre lo confirma. También, al ser gente pobre y sin importancia, cuando mueran, nadie se dará cuenta.\u000aNarrador: Es un narrador omnisciente pero completamente objetivo. Nunca da su opinión. Lo único que sabemos es lo que aprendemos acerca de los personajes. \u000aFinal: El cuento termina con una nota de confianza y optimism quizá el amor que existe en la familia ayuda a que el hijo no pierda la esperanza.

sVWe Have to Do Something
p2339
VThe dangerous contemporary fallacy that when "People are scared / People are angry / People are fed up / People want change" it becomes necessary to do something, anything, at once even if it is an overreaction, is a completely ineffective, inert placebo, or actually makes the situation worse, rather than "just sitting there doing nothing." (E.g., "Banning air passengers from carrying ham sandwiches onto the plane and making parents take off their newborn infants' tiny pink baby-shoes probably does nothing to deter potential hijackers, but people are scared and we have to do something to respond to this crisis!") This is a badly corrupted argument from pathos. (See also "Scare Tactic.")

p2441
VA Scottish general and the thane of Glamis. ("Thane" is a Scottish title of nobility, and Glamis is a village in eastern Scotland.) Macbeth is led to wicked thoughts by the prophecies of three witches, especially after their prophecy that he will be made thane of Cawdor comes true. Macbeth is a brave soldier and a powerful man, but he is not virtuous. He is easily tempted into murder to fulfill his ambitions to the throne, and once he commits his first crime and is crowned king of Scotland, he embarks on further atrocities with increasing ease. Macbeth cannot maintain his power because his increasingly brutal actions make him hated as a tyrant. Unlike Shakespeare's other great villains, such as Iago in Othello and Richard III in Richard III, who revel in their villainy, Macbeth is never comfortable in his role as a criminal. He shows at the beginning of the play that he knows right from wrong, and chooses to do wrong without being able to justify it to himself. Ultimately, he is unable to bear the psychic consequences of his atrocities.

p2789
VAn appeal to reason. It is one of the fundamental strategies of argumentation identified by Aristotle. It occurs when a writer tries to convince you of the logic of his argument. Writers may use inductive argumentation or deductive argumentation, but they clearly have examples and a generally rational tone to their language. The problem with logos is that it can appear reasonable until you dissect the argument and then you find fallacies which defeat the viability of the argument in the reader's eyes. Of course, that presupposes that the reader is able to identify the fallacy.
p2790
sVsyle
p2791
VThe consideration of style has two purposes: (1) An evaluation of the sum of the choices an author makes in\u000ablending diction, syntax, figurative language, and other literary devices. Some authors' styles are so\u000aidiosyncratic that we can quickly recognize works by the same author (or a writer emulating that author's\u000astyle)/ Compare, for example, Jonathan's Swift to George Orwell or William Faulkner to Ernest Hemingway.\u000aWe can analyze and describe an author's personal style and make judgments on how appropriate it is to the\u000aauthor's purpose. Styles can be called flowery, explicit, succinct, rambling, bombastic, commonplace,\u000aincisive, or laconic, to name only a few examples. (2) Classification of authors to a group and comparison\u000aof an author to similar authors. By means of such classification and comparison, we can see how an\u000aauthor's style reflects and helps to define a historical period, such as the Renaissance of the Victorian\u000aperiod, or a literary movement, such as the romantic, transcendental or realist movement.

p3325
VGenerally, anything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete -- such as an object, action, character, or scene - that represents something more abstract. However, symbols (1) natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to symbolize ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge). (2) conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scale of justice for lawyers). (3) literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are more generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated, as is the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

p4669
VA form of logical argumentation which employs the use of claims or premises. The assumption by the author is that you will accept the claims as true and that you will then deduce the correct conclusion from the accepted premises at the outset. Deductive reasoning looks most like geometry proofs. When you encounter a deductive argument, you need to examine the claims. Are they reasonable? Do you accept them? Look for fallacies in the claims. Often a premise will carry an implied premise as true? What appears to be solid reason can manipulate you allegiances more easily than an emotional argument; therefore, be critical when you read. Human beings are fallible. Therefore, one may conclude that there are structural flaws in parts of the infrastructure.

VGénero: Poesía \u000aSiglo: XIX\u000aMovimiento: Modernismo\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aImperialismo: Este poema fue escrito en las secuelas de la Guerra Española - Americana (1898 ) y la invasión de EE.UU. de Panamá ( 1902). Los intelectuales hispanoamericanos vieron esta guerra como un acto de agresión del gran país del norte para apoderarse de todo Hispanoamérica. Fue de ese temor al imperialismo norteamericano que surgió el espíritu 'antiyanqui' que, hasta cierto punto, ha perdurado hasta nuestros días. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aElementos modernistas: Los elementos modernistas de " A Roosevelt " son sus imágenes originales (por ejemplo , la subversión del símbolo de la estatua de la libertad ) y la experimentación con la versificación\u000aForma métrica: Verso libre( no tiene ni rima ni número fijo de sílabas) \u000aAntonomasia: 2ndo verso 'Cazador': Roosevelt. ; 5 verso 'cazado' : EE. UU. \u000aDescribe a EE.UU. como invasor y destructor de los indígenas; guerrero, pudiente, hábil. \u000aCaracterísticas unificadoras de Hispanoamérica: Idioma, religión, espíritu poético. \u000aContraste: Los norteamericanos son de almas bárbaras, y los latinos tienen altos valores cristianos.\u000aEl yo lírico indica explícitamente en el último verso que Dios está al lado de Hispanoamérica\u000aMetáfora: Crea una metonimia en la que las cordilleras (los Rockies; la Sierra Madre; los Andes) son vértebras. Cuando hay un terremoto en los Rockies, se siente el temblor por todo Hispanoamérica. EE.UU como otro símbolo de violencia e influencia. \u000aSignos: La estatua de la Libertad \u2192 Le da la bienvenida a los inmigrantes que entran por Ellis Island. \u2022 "Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free". \u2022 Lleva una antorcha para alumbrarles el camino a los nuevos inmigrantes. En vez de algo positivo, en la obra de Darío la antorcha se convierte en un instrumento para ayudar a los EE. UU. a conquistar Hispanoamérica. \u000aRoosevelt \u2192 Cazar, domar, asesinar, invasor, conquista, riflero, "en donde pones la bala el porvenir pones", temblor que estremece, "rugir del león", "férreas garras"\u000aAnáforas: Eres (6 veces), que (4 veces), la América (4 veces).

sVSymbol/symbolism -
p4867
VGenerally, anything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete - such as object, action, character, or scene - that represents something more abstract. However, symbols, and symbolism can be much more complex. One system classifies symbols in three categories: (1) Natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to represent ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge). (2) Conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scales of justice for lawyers). (3) Literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated as is the whale in Moby Dick and the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

sVArgumentum ad Mysteriam
p5133
VA darkened chamber, incense, chanting or drumming, bowing and kneeling, special robes or headgear, holy rituals and massed voices reciting sacred mysteries in an unknown tongue have a quasi-hypnotic effect and can often persuade more strongly than any logical argument. The Protestant Reformation was in large part a rejection of this fallacy. When used knowingly and deliberately this fallacy is particularly vicious and accounts for some of the fearsome persuasive power of cults. An example of an Argumentum ad Mysteriam is the "Long Ago and Far Away" fallacy, that facts, evidence, practices or arguments from ancient times, distant lands and/or "exotic" cultures acquire a special gravitas or ethos simply because of their antiquity, language or origin, e.g., chanting Holy Scriptures in their original languages, preferring the Greek, Latin or Assyrian Christian Liturgies over their vernacular versions, or using classic or newly made-up Latin names for fallacies to prove their validity. See also, Esoteric Knowledge.

sVPARALLEL SYNTAX (OR PARALLELISM)
p5515
VA pattern of language which creates a rhythm of repetition often combined with some other language of repetition. You can have parallel sets of sentences or parallel clauses within a sentence. Obviously, this is a significant element in syntactical analysis. The College Board loves to ask about parallel syntax and, as it is a sign of effective, strong writing, you should write this way as well. Parallel syntax may best be likened to a train gaining momentum: it drives through a piece of non- fiction prose gathering emotional stream as it goes. We will fight them on the beaches, and fight them in the hills, and fight them in the forests, and in the villages of the dell. Another famous speech filled with parallel syntax is Martin Luther, Jr.'s "I have a dream." Pick a line and it is likely parallel.

sVdiscourse or rhetorical modes
p5731
VThis is flexible term (sometimes referred to as modes of discourse) describes the variety, the conventions, and the purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes and their purposes are as follows: 1) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP language exam questions are frequently expository topics. 2) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, r point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having an additional aim of urging some form of action. 3) The purpose of description is to describe. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straight forward and objective or highly emotional and subjective. 4) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing.

sVRHETORICAL MODEs
p5929
VThis flexible term describes the variety, the conventions, and the purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes (often referred to as "modes of discourse") are as follows:(a) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP language exam essay questions are frequently expository topics. (b) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having an additional aim of urging some form of action.(c) The purpose of description is to recreate, invent, or visually present a person, place, event or action so that the reader can picture that being described. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straightforward and objective or highly emotional and subjective.d) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing.

Related to this is the well-known "Leading the Witness" Fallacy, where a sham, sarcastic or biased question is asked solely in order to evoke a desired answer.

sVLying with Statistics
p6565
VThe contemporary fallacy of using true figures and numbers to "prove" unrelated claims. (e.g. "College tuition costs have actually never been lower. When expressed as a percentage of the national debt, the cost of getting a college education is actually far lower today than it was in 1965!"). A corrupted argument from logos, often preying on the public's perceived or actual mathematical ignorance. This includes the Tiny Percentage Fallacy, that an expense that is quite significant in and of itself somehow becomes insignificant simply because it's a tiny percentage of something much larger. E.g., a consumer who would choke on spending an extra dollar for two cans of peas will typically ignore $50 extra on the price of a car or $1000 extra on the price of a house simply because these differences are "only" a tiny percentage of the much larger amount being spent. Historically, sales taxes or value-added taxes have successfully gained public acceptance and remain "under the radar" because of this latter fallacy. See also Half-truth, Snow Job, and Red Herring.

A real man stands tall, talks straight, draws fast and shoots to kill." The late actor John Wayne frequently portrayed this fallacy in his movie roles. See also, The Pout.

sVNon sequitur argument
p7373
VThis Latin phrase means "does not follow." A non sequitur is an argument in which claims, reasons, or warrants fail to connect logically; one point does not follow another. (Example: A child says to her parent "You don't love me or you'd buy me that bicycle!" Claim: You must not love me. Reason: because you haven't bought me that bicycle. Warrant: Buying bicycles for children is essential for loving them. Although the child might accept the warrant in her argument, her parent can see that she has made a non sequitur argument because bicycles don't necessarily follow love.)

sVThe Pollyanna Principle
p8693
VA traditional, often tragic fallacy of ethos, that of automatically (and falsely) assuming that everyone else in any given place, time and circumstance had or has basically the same wishes, desires, interests, concerns, ethics and moral code as "we" do. This fallacy practically if not theoretically denies both the reality of difference and the human capacity to chose radical evil. E.g., arguing that "The only thing most Nazi Storm Troopers wanted was the same thing we do, to live in peace and prosperity and to have a good family life," when the reality was radically otherwise. Dr. William Lorimer offers this explanation: "The Projection Bias is the flip side of the 'They're Not Like Us' fallacy. The Projection bias (fallacy) is 'They're just people like me, therefore they must be motivated by the same things that motivate me.' For example: 'I would never pull a gun and shoot a police officer unless I was convinced he was trying to murder me; therefore, when Joe Smith shot a police officer, he must have been in genuine fear for his life.' I see the same fallacy with regard to Israel: 'The people of Gaza just want to be left in peace; therefore, if Israel would just lift the blockade and allow Hamas to import anything they want, without restriction, they would stop firing rockets at Israel.' That may or may not be true - I personally don't believe it - but the argument clearly presumes that the people of Gaza, or at least their leaders, are motivated by a desire for peaceful co-existence.' The Pollyanna Principle was gently but expertly demolished in the classic twentieth-century American cartoon series, "The Flintstones," in which the humor lay in the absurdity of picturing "Stone Age" characters having the same concerns and lifestyles as mid-twentieth century white working class Americans. This is the opposite of the "They're Not Like Us" fallacy. (Note: The Pollyanna Principle fallacy should not be confused with a psychological principle of the same name which suggest that positive memories are retained more strongly than negative ones. )

VGénero: Poesía \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardia española - Generación del 98 \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGeneración del 98: Grupo de novelistas, poetas, ensayistas y filósofos españoles, activos durante y después de la Guerra de Cuba (1898), que restauraron a España a una prominencia intelectual y literaria. Les era de gran importancia definir a España como una entidad cultural e histórica.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDivisiones socioeconómicas: Antonio Machado, "He andado muchos caminos," talks about the presumptuous upper classes and compares them with the simple life of Spanish peasants. \u000aEl enigma de la existencia: Machado pits two types of people, which together represent humanity for the poet. One group is educated and sophisticated, and the other is simple and unpretentious. The elite group is viewed as pompous and unhappy, while the simple folks are content. The famous poem also expresses doubt in the immortality of the soul, ending with the fact that someday these folks "descansan bajo la tierra"\u2014not in heaven.\u000a"La gente mala"= ricos: Son tristes, soberbias, melancólicas, presuntuosas, farsantes ("al paño") y arrogantes (creen que saben lo que es el buen vivir). \u000aGente pobre: Danzan, juegan, trabajan, no son ambiciosos ni mezquinos ni arrogantes (toman cualquier vino), etc\u000aA pesar de su admiración por la gente pobre no deja de incluir signos de su triste realidad: Cabalgan en mulas viejas, solo tienen cuatro palmos de tierra, repite el verbo "laborar" dos veces. \u000aExperiencia de la vida (yo lírico): Utiliza verbos de diferentes actividades: andar, abrir, navegar, atracar. \u000aForma métrica: Octosílabo, rima asonante con patrón e/a en versos pares\u000aEl encabalgamiento: no permite que la voz pare al fin del verso; por lo tanto, no se enfatiza la rima.

VGénero: Poesía ( verso libre) \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: La vanguardia- Surrealismo hispanoamericano\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aAunque el arte surrealista intenta captar una super realidad, en sus obras, este ambiente se expresa con elementos de sorpresa y signos yuxtapuestos de un modo ilógico que lo alejan de la realidad reconocible. Es como la realidad de los sueños, los cuales a veces no tienen sentido y, sin embargo, revelan los secretos importantes de nuestra subconciencia. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aExistencialismo: La agonía de la existencia está en exhibición en el poema. Se construye un mundo surrealista donde los signos son inconexos e incomprensibles . Un hombre camina a través del espacio creado confundido, atormentado , y sorprendido por el mundo que él ve y no entiende. \u000aCansancio ( yo lírico 1eras tres estrofas): de su persona física, de su existencia, de su rutina diaria, del mundo que lo circunda. \u000aEstrofa 4 y 5: Ocurrencias divertidas pero bastante grotescas- matar a una monja y asustar a un notario. \u000aSignos subterráneos: Raíz, "extendido . . . hacia abajo, en las tripas mojadas de la tierra", tumba (bodega con muertos), subterráneo, etc. \u000aAngustia (estrofa 7): El dolor de ver a tanta gente sufrir. \u000aImágenes surrealistas: Los huesos que salen de las ventanas de los hospitales, zapaterías que huelen a vinagre, intestinos colgados de las puertas de las casas, dentaduras en cafeteras, espejos que lloran, ombligos en todas partes, etc. Signos grotescos: "intestinos colgando de las puertas", "dentaduras olvidadas en una cafetera", etc. \u000aSignos - Centro urbano: Verbos-Empujar, pasearse, cruzar. Edificios- hospitales, zapaterías, calles, casas, oficinas de ortopedia, patios, ropa secándose, etc. \u000aVerso libre: No tiene número fijo de sílabas ni rima. \u2022 Típico del Surrealismo, el poema carece de una organización rígida de ideas, así que el verso libre es apropiado para un poema libre.\u000aTono: Irónico y de decepción. Con desesperación, repugnancia, pena, furia, etc. Casi todos los signos ayudan a expresar el tono angustioso del poema. \u000aDegradación del ser: Se cansa de las partes de su cuerpo y de seguir sustanciándose (absorbiendo líquidos y comiendo). \u2022 Todo lo que ve en su paseo es antinatural; las cosas no son como deben ser (la ropa recién lavada produce gotas sucias, etc.). \u000aMetáfora: El hombre como raíz- Para absorber agua; para que se mantenga viva; etc. \u2022El yo lírico no quiere vivir; no quiere tener la responsabilidad de ser un sostén; etc. \u000aFiguras retóricas: \u000aAnáforas: Sucede/sucede, sólo/sólo, no/no, y/y, a/a, hay/hay, etc.; \u000aAliteraciones: "sucede que me canso de ser hombre" combina /s/ y /e/, sonidos nasales en /m/ y /n/, etc.; \u000aOnomatopeya/Polisíndeton: estrofa 8; estrofas 8 y 9. \u000aRitmo (últimos versos del poema): Es como una gradación descendente con aliteración en /l/. Además de su efecto fónico, hace que el verso se lea despacio, como gotas que caen. \u000aPersonificación (final): Los espejos y la ropa lloran. Pero las lágrimas, en vez de ser limpias, como se esperaría de ropa lavada, son sucias

VA fallacy of logos stemming from the paradox that beyond a certain point, more explanation, instructions or discussion inevitably results in less, not more, understanding.

"Mansplaining" is, according to scholar Danelle Pecht, "the infuriating tendency of many men to always have to be the smartest person in the room, regardless of the topic of discussion and how much they actually know!"

VGénero: Prosa- Cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom Latinoamericano \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aRuldo capta lo universal del carácter mexicano con un estilo puro y poético. Se le considera uno de los mayores cuentistas del idioma español. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aLas relaciones familiares entre los padres e hijos: los padres tienen amor incondicional a sus hijos y mantienen una comunicación abierta con ellos.\u000aVoz narrativa: Es completamente objetivo. Nunca interpreta las acciones de los personajes. Solamente las cuenta. \u000aEstilo: Capta el habla sobrio y melódico del campesino mexicano. Espacio: Es también un paisaje parco y seco. \u000aSimbolismo: Luna/ Sol\u2192 El sol alumbra el lugar para salvar al hijo; durante la noche están perdidos. Algunos críticos han especulado que la luna es la madre, que lo alumbra. Tonaya significa en una lengua indígena "sol"\u000aPresencia de la madre: El padre la recuerda constantemente; ella existe en la memoria. \u2022 Relación de los padres era íntima, de mucho amor; el padre la extraña mucho. \u000aForma de Usted/Tú: Hace el cambio cuando se enoja con el hijo. \u2022 La forma de usted crea distancia entre los dos, como si el padre apenas conociera al hijo. Pero sus últimas palabras usa la forma de tú, la forma familiar. \u000aÚltimas palabras del padre: "No me ayudaste ni siquiera en esta esperanza". \u2022 El padre, a pesar de lo que ha dicho, ha tenido la esperanza de salvar al hijo. Fuerte amor del padre: El padre lo lleva cargado (es una carga que el padre está dispuesto a aguantar); el hijo le pide que lo baje y lo abandone, y posiblemente llora. \u000aLágrimas o sangre (la gota que le cae en la frente al padre): El padre prefiere que sea una lágrima porque sería una confesión y arrepentimiento por sus pecados. Parte de la salvación que busca el padre no es solo lo físico sino lo espiritual. Al arrepentirse, Ignacio se salva. \u000aFinal: Muerte del hijo \u2192 por la descripción de que al bajarse de los hombros estaba como descoyuntado y el padre tiene que destrabar los dedos del hijo de su cuello.

sVtraditional wisdom
p11053
Vwhen a wrong or an unsuitable practice is justified on grounds that it follows a traditional accepted way of doing things. It is difficult for some people to change because change brings risks, inevitably. (ie: not wanting to eliminate biased practices based on gender, racial, or religious biases because that's the way things have ALWAYS been done in the "good ole days."). Those who benefit from these practices find it hard to entertain the idea that there could possibly be anything wrong with them. We do want to learn from past experiences, so we shouldn't assume that just because things have been done in the past, that it is right to do that thing NOW. All innovations go against past practices (From the introduction of plows that dig deeper furrows (a practice resisted at first by the North African farmers) to the elimination of practices based on racial, religious, or gender bias in the US). Tradition should be a guide not a jailer. Jeremy Bentham once said that when someone is guilty of abuse of power, the ONLY way for them to defend that abuse is to use a fallacy. Therefore it is important for them to keep the people stupid so that they can't distinguish truth from error.(under Two Wrongs category)

The Israelites feared that Moses would not return and asked Aaron to make idols or gods for them to worship. Aaron complied and gathered up the Israelites' golden earrings. He melted them and constructed the golden calf. Aaron also built an altar before the calf. The next day, the Israelites made offerings and celebrated. Meanwhile, the Lord told Moses that his people had corrupted themselves in idolizing false gods ("worshiping false idols"), and that he planned to punish them, which he did, later having been convinced by Moses to spare the Jews for the time being.

p11917
Vanything that represents itself and stands for something else. Usually a symbol is something concrete -- such as an object, action, character, or scene - that represents something more abstract. However, symbols and symbolism can be much more complex. One system classifies symbols into three categories: A. natural symbols are objects and occurrences from nature to symbolize ideas commonly associated with them (dawn symbolizing hope or a new beginning, a rose symbolizing love, a tree symbolizing knowledge).\u000aB. conventional symbols are those that have been invested with meaning by a group (religious symbols such as a cross or Star of David; national symbols, such as a flag or an eagle; or group symbols, such as a skull and crossbones for pirates or the scale of justice for lawyers).\u000aC. literary symbols are sometimes also conventional in the sense that they are found in a variety of works and are more generally recognized. However, a work's symbols may be more complicated, as is the jungle in Heart of Darkness. On the AP exam, try to determine what abstraction an object is a symbol for and to what extent it is successful in representing that abstraction.

VGénero: Literatura documental (crónica) \u000aSiglo: Época colonial (XVI)\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aEfecto de la cultura del individuo cuando describe otra cultura ajena: Cortés admira la cultura azteca, pero porque no son cristianos, los considera bárbaros. Por contraste, el poeta azteca de "Se ha perdido el pueblo Mexicatl" expresa sentimientos muy semejantes a los que expresara un europeo al perder su nación y su identidad. \u2022 Nosotros los lectores encontramos muy raras las imágenes, la lógica y las supersticiones descritas en "Los presagios", precisamente porque somos de otra cultura. \u000a"Se ha perdido el pueblo Mexicatl" -This lament expresses the deep pain and frustration of the loss of the Mexican homeland to Spanish conquistadores. It's an excellent example of the voz del vencido that was silenced for so many centuries. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a Los presagios: Fueron dichos en náhuatl y transcritos directamente al castellano, de modo que se oye la sintaxis de otro idioma. 2.Uso de perífrasis porque no conocen el signo. Por lo visto, nunca habían visto cometas. 3. Presagio 7: Caballos porque el caballo es animal del viejo mundo. 4. Sahagún no interviene en los dicen los informantes porque la rara sintaxis lo comprueba. 5. No se puede estar del todo cierto si el mensaje se captó tal como quería el emisor ya que es un texto traducido del náhuatl al castellano\u000a "Se ha perdido el pueblo Mexicatl" - 4to verso Un sentido de asombro, de fatalidad, de confusión; El llant recalca el dolor; Comparación metafórica: habitantes=mujeres porque huyen en vez de luchar; Oposición binaria: Por un lado se echan la culpa a ellos mismos y luego a Dios.

sVSentence Structure*
p12923
VWhen an essay question asks you to analyze sentence structure, look at the type of sentences the author uses. Remember that the basic sentence structures are simple, compound, and complex, and variations created with sentence combining. Also consider variation or lack of it in sentence length, and unusual devices in sentence construction, such as repetition or inverted word order, and any unusual word or phrase placement. As with all devices, be prepared to discuss the effect of the sentence structure. (ex. A series of short, simple sentences or phrases can produce a feeling of speed and choppiness, which may suit the author's purpose.)

sVArgumentum ex Silentio
p14121
VThe fallacy that if available sources remain silent or current knowledge and evidence can prove nothing about a given subject or question this fact in itself proves something about the truth of the matter. E.g., "Science can tell us nothing about God. That proves God doesn't exist." Or "Science admits it can tell us nothing about God, so you can't deny that God exists!" Often misused in the American justice system, where, contrary to the 5th Amendment, remaining silent or "taking the Fifth" is often falsely portrayed as proof of guilt. E.g., "Mr. Hixel has no alibi for the evening of January 15th. This proves that he was in fact in room 331 at the Smuggler's Inn, murdering his wife with a hatchet!" In today's America, choosing to remain silent in the face of a police officer's questions can make one guilty enough to be arrested or even shot. See also, Argument from Ignorance.

sVTone Policing
p15895
VA corrupt argument from pathos, the fallacy of judging the validity of an argument primarily by its emotional tone of delivery, ignoring the reality that a valid fact or argument remains valid whether it is offered calmly and deliberatively or is shouted in a "shrill" or even "hysterical" tone, whether calmly stated in professional, academic language or screamed out through a bull-horn and peppered with vulgarity. Conversely, a highly urgent emotional matter is still urgent even if argued coldly and rationally. This fallacy creates a false dichotomy between reason and emotion and thus implicitly favors those who are not personally involved or emotionally invested in an argument, e.g., "I know you're upset, but I won't discuss it until you calm down," or "I'd believe what you write were it not for your adolescent use of exclamation points throughout the text." Or alternately, "You seem to be way too calm about the death of your spouse. You're under arrest for homicide. You have the right to remain silent..." Tone Policing is frequent in contemporary discourse of power, particularly in response to discourse of protest.

sVPoint of view In literature, the perspective from which a story is told. There are two general divisions of point of view, and many subdivisions within those. (1) the first person narrator tells the story with the first person pronoun, "I," and is a character in the story. This narrator can be the protagonist, a participant (character in a secondary role), or an observer (a character who merely watches the action). 2) the third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: omniscient and limited omniscient. In the "third person omniscient" point of view, the narrator, with godlike knowledge., present the thoughts and actions of any or all characters. This all-knowing narrator can reveal what each character feels and thinks at any given moment. The "third person limited omniscient" point of view, as its name implies, presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only\u000athe actions of all remaining characters. This definition applies in question in the multiple-choice section. However on the essay portion of the exam, the "point of view" carries an additional meaning. When you are asked to analyze the author's point of view, the appropriate point for you to address is the author's attitude.

VA postmodern fallacy, a counterpart of the "Name Calling" fallacy, supposing that the nature of a thing or situation can be changed by simply changing its name. E.g., "Today we strike a blow for animal rights and against cruelty to animals by changing the name of 'pets' to 'animal companions.'" Or "Never, ever play the 'victim' card, because it's so manipulative and sounds so negative, helpless and despairing. Instead of saying 'victims,' we are 'survivors.'" Also applies to other forms of political "Language Control," e.g., being careful never to refer to North Korea or ISIS/ISIL by their rather pompous proper names ("the Democratic People's Republic of Korea" and "the Islamic State," respectively) or to the Syrian government as the "Syrian government," (It's always the "Regime" or the "Dictatorship.").

VAn argument is valid if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

However, the argument is not sound, because one of its premises is clearly untrue.\u000aPremise: All flightless birds are man-eaters.\u000aPremise: The penguin is a flightless bird.\u000aConclusion: Therefore, the penguin is a man-eater.\u000aThe following argument is not valid, even though its premises are true:\u000aPremise: All baseballs are round.\u000aPremise: All basketballs are round.\u000aPremise: No football is round.\u000aPremise: The earth is round.\u000aConclusion: The earth is either a baseball or a basketball, but not a football.

sVMujer Negra; Nancy Morejon
p19719
VGénero: Poesía contemporánea \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Feminismo\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aElla describe , en una manera universal y épica, lo que las mujeres negras han soportado a través de los siglos.\u000aSe sugiere en el poema que la clave para la emancipación es una revolución comunista como la de Cuba\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTiempo y espacio: cada etapa temporal en la vida de los africanos va acompañada por un espacio correspondiente: "la espuma del mar" y "el primer alcatraz que divisé" captan el espacio del viaje en barco de la esclava a Cuba [las olas del océano y el ave que ve captan . . . .] , etc. El poema va desde los orígenes (África) al presente (Cuba). En ese \u000atranscurrir de tiempo y espacio, el "yo lírico" se va alejando de su tierra original y acepta ser parte de otra nueva tierra.\u000aEl yo lírico: Puede ser las dos cosas, pero ella se proyecta como representante de todas las mujeres africanas. \u2022 Primera persona plural. Indica que ella es parte de un grupo mucho más grande (todas las esclavas traídas al Caribe). \u000aForma métrica: Verso libre. No tiene número fijo de sílabas ni patrón de rima\u000aTransmisión de la cultura africana fue por vía oral, pero con el paso del tiempo se olvida de dónde proviene; ahora es solo cubana. \u000aEspacio: Empieza con el mar que atravesó como esclava; pasa al campo donde laboró; luego al monte donde se refugió; termina en un lugar mítico donde todo se comparte igualmente. \u000aSignos positivos: Canto milenario, azul montaña, magia y quimera, bailar, pródiga madera que resuena, etc\u000aEl comunismo de Cuba (según el yo lírico): Les ha dado la tierra; ahora es de ellos. Se debe notar el uso repetido del posesivo, lo cual implica que Cuba es de ellos y no de "generales y burgueses". \u2022 El árbol cuya madera resuena, o sea, el árbol plantado por ellos empieza a tener resonancia.

Also refers to the fallacy of arguing that something is a certain way "by nature," an empty claim that no amount of proof can refute. (E.g., "Americans are cold and greedy by nature," or "Women are naturally better cooks than men.") See also "Default Bias." The opposite of this is the fallacy of Relativizing, blithely dismissing any and all arguments against one's standpoint by shrugging one's shoulders and responding that "Everything's relative," or falsely invoking Einstein, Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle or Quantum Weirdness to confuse, mystify or "refute" an opponent. See also, "Red Herring."

sVDiminished Responsibility
p20907
VThe common contemporary fallacy of applying a specialized judicial concept (that criminal punishment should be less if one's judgment was impaired) to reality in general. E.g., "You can't count me absent on Monday--I was hung over and couldn't come to class so it's not my fault." Or, "Yeah, I was speeding on the freeway and killed a guy, but I was buzzed out of my mind and didn't know what I was doing so it didn't matter that much." In reality the death does matter very much to the victim, to his family and friends and to society in general. Whether the perpetrator was high or not does not matter at all since the material results are the same. This also includes the fallacy of Panic, a very common contemporary fallacy that one's actions, no matter how damaging or evil, somehow don't "count" because "I panicked!" This fallacy is rooted in the confusion of "consequences" with "punishment."

VGénero: Narrativa contemporánea (cuento)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Literatura feminista ( se asocia también con el Boom)\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aDurante gran parte de los siglos XIX y XX, muchos países de Hispanoamérica fueron arrasados por guerras civiles entre grupos opuestos que querían tomar el poder. Algunas veces,un oficial del ejército pronunciaba un golpe de estado y gobernaba como dictador absoluto. Muchas veces, estos caudillos tenían muy poca experiencia para gobernar y carecían de la educación formal. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aLa construcción de género: Belisa, la heroína de Allende de " Dos palabras " es verdaderamente una mujer moderna , en la que ella lucha por sobrevivir sola, sin la ayuda de ningún hombre, y a través de su ingenio, inteligencia, e ingenio \u000ase las arregla para controlar a los hombres e incluso transformarlos.\u000aDiscurso histórico social: La pobreza, la guerra civil, líderes que quieren poder para mejorar sus vidas, líderes incultos, etc. \u2022 El Coronel quiere conquistar al pueblo democráticamente, pero el Mulato quiere un golpe de estado. \u000aSimbolismo: Crepusculario -Un nuevo empezar. \u000aMachismo: Brutal, autoritario, salvaje. \u000aFemenino ante lo masculino: Lo suaviza y domina. \u000aDiscurso metalingüístico-Las palabras: Belisa descubre que las palabras no son propiedad de nadie. \u000a\u2022 Belisa descarta las palabras cacofónicas y las voces floridas, oscuras, sobre usadas, etc., para quedarse solamente con las exactas y las capaces de tocar el cerebro y el corazón. \u2022 Las palabras de Belisa tienen al pueblo embelesado \u2014hasta se aprenden frases del discurso de memoria. \u2022Ella escoge las palabras más justas. Ella quiere conmoverlos. \u2022\u000aBelisa/Isabel: Es la misma palabra con las sílabas al revés. Es autorreferencial porque se trata de una escritora (Isabel) que escribe sobre otra escritora (Belisa)\u000aTema: El poder transformador de las palabras" -transforma al individuo. Lo especial de este caso es que una mujer es la que ejerce influencia para transformar al general\u000aEl amor - La capacidad del amor, así como la de la literatura, de transformar al individuo\u000aEl no decir el contenido del discurso: Hace al lector un participante en el acto de leer, ya que tiene que poner su parte e intuir.

sVThe Affective Fallacy
p21341
VA fallacy of Pathos, that one's emotions, urges or "feelings" are in every case self-validating, autonomous, and above any human intent or act of will (one's own or others'), and are thus beyond challenge or critique. In this fallacy one argues, "My feelings are valid, so therefore you have no right to criticize what I say or do, or how I say it or do it." This latter is also a fallacy of stasis, confusing reasoned response or refutation with personal devaluation, disrespect, prejudice, bigotry, sexism, homophobia or hostility. A grossly sexist form of the Affective Fallacy is the well-known fallacy that a phallus "Has No Conscience," i.e., since (particularly male) sexuality is self-validating and beyond voluntary control what one does with it cannot be controlled and is not open to criticism, an assertion eagerly embraced and extended beyond the male gender in certain reifications of "Desire" in contemporary academic theory. See also, Playing on Emotion. Opposite to this fallacy is the Chosen Emotion Fallacy (thanks to scholar Marc Lawson for identifying this fallacy), in which one falsely claims reliable prior voluntary control over one's own "gut level" internal affective reactions. Related to this last is the ancient fallacy of Angelism, falsely claiming that one is capable of reasoning without emotion or pretending to place oneself above all emotion.

sVEl Caballo Mago; Sabine R. Ulibarri
p22741
VGénero: Prosa contemporánea - Cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Literatura chicana\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEs una alegoría poética de un niño de la mayoría de edad. El caballo adquiere una serie de significados simbólicos que \u000aun niño debe aprender a convertirse en un hombre. Más allá del simbolismo sexual evidente , el caballo es también un \u000aideal , una meta inalcanzable, la belleza de lo intangible , etc.\u000aCaballo blanco: Todos lo admiran; cuentan muchas historias de él; todos han intentado capturarlo, pero ninguno lo ha logrado\u000aNarrador: El chico. Narra en primera persona. \u2022 Son recuerdos, pero narra en el presente. Transformación de la narrativa: Con el tiempo se suavizan, se exageran, se idealizan, etc. El recuerdo es demasiado poético; se basa en reminiscencias idealizadas por el tiempo\u000aEstilo: Es un estilo poético. Las oraciones son cortas y a veces fragmentadas. Hay mucha adjetivación. La naturaleza se humaniza y personifica. Hay muchos recursos poéticos: metáforas y símiles como en el primer párrafo; epíteto (al llamar al caballo "el brujo"); personificación ("el bosque se calla"); graduación ("al atraparlo se volvía espuma y aire y nada"); paradoja ("lloraba de alegría); ,etc. No es un estilo realista porque todo se idealiza y poetiza. No hay problemas económicos, sociales o morales como suele haber en los discursos realistas. \u000aRecursos poéticos: \u000aSímil: "libre como la alegría" \u000agradación y polisíndeton: "al atraparlo se volvía espuma, y aire, y nada"\u000aProsopopeya, personificación: "De pronto el bosque se calla"\u000aParadoja, oxímoron: "La eternidad momentánea" \u000aParadoja, ironía: "Lloraba de alegría"\u000aSimbolismo: Caballo- La belleza, lo inefable, lo imposible, la virilidad, etc. \u2022 El caballo como viril es un emblema en la literatura. Es el macho semental de una majada de yeguas. En el cuento todos los hombres lo admiran. \u000a El narrador tiene quince años y está experimentando la pubertad; quiere ser como el caballo semental para, como dice, "lucirlo . . . cuando las muchachas salen a paseo por la calle".

sVVolveran las oscuras golondrinas; Gustavo Adolfo Becquer
p23715
VGénero: Poesía \u000aSiglo: XIX\u000aMovimiento: Romanticismo tardío \u000aContexto histórico: \u000aBécquer es el poeta lírico más melódico y exquisito del siglo XIX e influyó mucho a los poetas del Modernismo, Ecos del discurso amoroso de su poesía se escuchan hasta hoy día en la lírica hispánica. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aBécquer's famous "Volverán las oscuras golondrinas" is structured on concepts of time and space. It describes the coming of spring, with the return of the swallows and the blooming honeysuckle\u2014the perfect setting for lovers. Of course, the poem turns heartbreaking as the poem's female character turns a deaf ear to the male's sincere love. The poem could easily have been part of "La construcción del género," as it shows the ungrateful woman rejecting the sincere love of the man. \u000aForma métrica: Pie quebrado(1eros tres versos) \u2192 Once (endecasílabo) Patrón de rima: ar/an. \u000aElementos estructurales: elemento cíclico\u2192 volverán los pájaros y flores; No volverán las especiales que llamaron la atención a los amantes. Barreras: Cristales del balcón, la tapia, el sueño (la indiferencia de la mujer). El yo poético quiere saltar esas barreras (las golondrinas hacen nidos, las madreselvas escalan la tapia y el amante, con palabras y de rodillas, ruega)\u000aAliteración: produce musicalidad con los sonidos alveolares /l/, /n/, /r/, /v/ \u2192 ej. Volverán las oscuras golondrinas\u000aAnadiplosis: Varias estrofas terminan con "volverán" y las siguientes empiezan con la misma palabra \u000aSímil: Las gotas de rocío se convierten en lágrimas \u000aTiempo: pasado a futuro \u2192 El yo lírico recuerda golondrinas, madreselvas y amor e implica que volverán en el futuro; Tiempo cíclico de la naturaleza: El renacimiento de la naturaleza en la primavera. Comparación Amor = naturaleza indica que el amor puede renacer también. Pero hay que recordar que no vuelven ciertas cosas particulares y especiales: unas golondrinas, unas flores y un amor especial.

p24089
VMetaphor compares one thing with another by equating the two. Because it blatantly equates two distinct things, metaphor allows us to draw stronger comparisons than we can with simile or other methods of comparison. We can use metaphors to ask our readers to think about connections between things in new and original ways. \u000a\u000aExample 1: "Time is money."\u000a\u000aExample2: "But is this a logical assertion? Isn't this like condemning a robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery? Isn't this like condemning Socrates because his unswerving commitment to truth and his philosophical inquiries precipitated the act by the misguided populace in which they made him drink hemlock? Isn't this like condemning Jesus because his unique God-consciousness and never-ceasing devotion to God's will precipitated the evil act of crucifixion? We must come to see that, as the federal courts have consistently affirmed, it is wrong to urge an individual to cease his efforts to gain his basic constitutional rights because the quest may precipitate violence. Society must protect the robbed and punish the robber."\u000aWhy We Can't Wait

sVrhetorical terms
p25825
VThis flexible term describes the variety, the conventions, and the purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes (often referred to as "modes of discourse") are as follows: 1) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting sound reasoning, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP Language exam essay questions are frequently expository topics. 2) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having the additional aim of urging some from of action. 3) The purpose of description is to recreate, invent, or visually present a person, place, event or action so that the reader can picture that being described. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straightforward and objective or highly emotional and subjective. 4) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing.

VIn its basic form, this is a three-part argument construction in which two premises lead to a truth. The term has appeared in the multiple-choice section a few times, but it is also helpful if you can both spot and use a syllogistic argument. In its simplest form, a syllogism looks like this: All human beings are mortal. Heather is a human being. Therefore, Heather is mortal. You can also produce really odd ones that are incorrect. All crows are black. The bird in my back yard is black. The bird in my back yard is a crow. This is a false argument because an implied premise, all black birds are crows, is false, thus the logic falls apart. Some televisions are black and white. Some televisions are penguins. There is both misinformation here and false implied premises. Also, despite these simple examples, you can have a syllogistic argument set up in three paragraphs. An essential truth is defended. An essential truth is defended. A conclusion is drawn.

In those days the church was not merely a thermometer that recorded the ideas and principles of popular opinion; it was a thermostat that transformed the mores of society. Whenever the early Christians entered a town, the people in power became disturbed and immediately sought to convict the Christians for being "disturbers of the peace" and "outside agitators"' But the Christians pressed on, in the conviction that they were "a colony of heaven," called to obey God rather than man. Small in number, they were big in commitment. They were too God intoxicated to be "astronomically intimidated." By their effort and example they brought an end to such ancient evils as infanticide and gladiatorial contests."\u000aWhy We Can't Wait

VMEANING: keep the momentum going\u000aORIGIN: the phrase owes its origin and popularity to the US presidential election of July 1840.

Harrison's campaign literature referred to Victory Balls. These weren't, as we might expect, dance parties that celebrated his famous victory, but ten-foot diameter globes made of tin and leather, which were pushed from one campaign rally to the next. His supporters were invited to attend rallies and push the ball on to the next town, chanting 'keep the ball rolling'

sVfly in the ointment
p27297
VMEANING: used to express a drawback, especially one that was not at first apparent\u000aORIGIN: A likely source is a phrase in the King James Bible: "Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savour." (Ecclesiastes 10:1) For five centuries now 'a fly in the ointment' has meant a small defect that spoils something valuable or is a source of annoyance. The modern version thus suggests that something unpleasant may come or has come to light in a proposition or condition that is almost too pleasing; that there is something wrong hidden, unexpected somewhere

sVThe Taboo
p28559
VThe fallacy of unilaterally declaring certain arguments, standpoints or actions "sacrosanct" and not open to discussion, or arbitrarily taking some tones, standpoints or options "off the table" beforehand. (E.g., " "No, let's not discuss my sexuality," "Don't bring my drinking into this," or "Before we start, you need to know I won't allow you to play the race card or allow you to attack my arguments by claiming 'That's just what Hitler would say!'") Also applies to discounting or rejecting certain arguments and evidence out of hand because they are "against the Bible" or other sacred doctrine (See also the A Priori Argument). This fallacy occasionally degenerates into a separate, distracting argument over who gets to define the parameters, tone and taboos of the main argument, though at this point reasoned discourse most often breaks down and the entire affair becomes a naked Argumentun ad Baculum. See also, Tone Policing.

Instead, we must always expect defeat and be ready to roll with the punches by developing "grit" or "resilience" as a primary survival skill. This nihilist fallacy is a practical negation of the the possibility of any argument from logos.

sVIf we allow this reasonable thing, it'll inevitably lead to an extreme version of it. It is a fallacy because it leads to a wrong conclusion. \u000a\u000a"The problem with this reasoning is that it avoids engaging with the issue at hand, and instead shifts attention to extreme hypotheticals. Because no proof is presented to show that such extreme hypotheticals will in fact occur, this fallacy has the form of an appeal to emotion fallacy by leveraging fear. In effect the argument at hand is unfairly tainted by unsubstantiated conjecture." (Source)\u000aExample in Heinrichs: "If I let you skip dinner, then I'll have to let the other kids skip dinner" (Heinrichs 160). \u000aOther example: "You should never gamble. Once you start gambling you find it hard to stop. Soon you are spending all your money on gambling, and eventually you will turn to crime to support your earnings." (Source)\u000aReal example: Directv Commercial\u000aPossible credibility: This fallacy could be persuasive because it crafts unrelated consequences and can thus easily dissuade the audience from making a decision.

En el poema de Burgos, sin embargo, el artista se eleva en el triunfo sobre el ser humano, mientras que en el Borges los dos \u000ase fusionan hasta el punto de cada ser son indistinguibles del otro. \u000aMetaliteratura: En "Borges y yo" y "A Julia de Burgos" se presenta la tensión entre el ser y el escritor. En ambas obras se manifiesta que son diferentes entidades, implicando que las palabras que se leen en una obra no son necesariamente las del ser humano que las escribe\u000aIronía metaliteraria: El narrador escribe igual que el Borges de quien escribe. También hay un autocrítica cuando se queja de la "perversa costumbre de falsear y magnificar" de Borges el autor.\u000aIdentidad:Puede haber dos máscaras diferentes, pero en el fondo hay una sola persona. Irónicamente, aquí el autor domina al hombre \u2014lo embruja de tal modo que no puede escaparse. \u000aDiscurso religioso: salvación y perdición. El que escribe, por su fama, se salva; el otro, el "yo", muere del todo. Es una interpretación existencialista de la vida.

VGénero: Poesía ( Alejandrino; verso blanco o suelto)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Feminismo/Postmodernismo \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: Verso blanco (o suelto)- el verso blanco tiene una métrica estructurada( alejandrino=catorce sílabas, pero sin rima. \u000aTiene gran libertad y licencia poética, ya que no tiene ningún esquema de la rima regular. A pesar de que las dos últimas estrofas tienen rima consonante , esto no influye en su carácter de verso blanco.\u000aDualidad del ser: se centra en la relación del artista con su imagen pública. Demuestra claramente la " dualidad del ser" \u000aya que la poeta Julia de Burgos se enfrenta la mujer Julia de Burgos lo que indica claramente que son personajes muy diferentes . La implicación es que la persona verdadera y honesta es la poeta ; la \u000a"Otra" es un ser social confinado y determinado por toda una serie de obligaciones sociales. \u000aDesdoblamiento: se relaciona con la proyección del yo en otro\u000aYo: la verdad, sincera, altruista, libre e independiente, manda a sí misma, pueblo, etc.; tú: la mentira, hipócrita, egoísta, atada a su marido y a la sociedad, todos la mandan, aristócrata, etc. \u000aMujer social: Hipocresía: hace lo que demanda la sociedad. La mujer social tiene que aparentar su feminidad: rizarse el pelo, pintarse, etc. Tiene que obedecer a su marido, sus padres, la religión y las fuerzas sociales. Como esposa tiene que ser sumisa y satisfacer primero a su esposo, etc Mujer poeta: Sinceridad: hace lo que es natural y justo. \u000aContraste binario: Frío/destello, atar/correr desbocado, aristocracia/pueblo, etc. \u000aTono- Moralista y profético: La poeta representa todo lo bueno y la mujer social todo lo malo. El bien triunfará sobre el mal. \u2022 La primera virtud es la humildad, y la poeta no es humilde. Todo lo contrario, se jacta de su superioridad como persona. \u000aAnáforas: ("mi voz / tu voz" [4]; "no mandas / te mandan" [24]; repetición de "mi" [30]; etc.) \u2022 27-29; 32-33 \u2022 Muchas empiezan con "tú".

Retributivists believe we ARE justified in punishing those guilty of unfairly harming others even though in doing so we fail to fight the original harm (someone murdered someone or stole from someone, and we put that person in jail. It doesn't counter-act the crime, but it punishes the offender). The Two Wrongs fallacy sometimes seems plausible for another reason: to counter-act hypocrisy. For example a cheating husband won't get much sympathy when he complains of his wife's infidelity or an alcoholic calling out someone for being drunk won't really work. (under Two Wrongs category)

VGénero: Novela picaresca (novela realista)\u000aSiglo: XVI\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico:\u000a*Una vez más, el Lazarillo nos ofrece un ejemplo ideal. La hipocresía y la corrupción que Lazarillo descubre en la España del siglo XVI directamente influye su comportamiento y sus relaciones interpersonales. No es que Lázaro también abrace la hipocresía y la corrupción, sino que se retira de la sociedad y se hace un recluso a quien no le importa nada o nadie\u000a*Lazarillo a lo mejor fue escrito por un judío converso que se sentía marginado en la España de su época y había abrazado los cambios de la Reforma: la corrupción del clero y la hipocresía de las bulas eran temas de crítica de los protestantes. También quería pintar un cuadro\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aRelaciones interpersonales: Lazarillo is replete with examples. But let's focus on three. (1) Lazarillo's mother and Zaide form a warm and supporting relationship. However, because it's illicit by the moral and racial norms of the period, it is forced to break up. This provides an interesting example of how moral codes and systems of power affect and control human relationships. (2) Lazarillo's relationship to the escudero in the third chapter clearly illustrates the young boy's capacity for compassion for an individual who is the victim of the ridiculous honor codes of Golden Age Spain. (3) The relationship of Lazarillo to his unfaithful wife demonstrates how some relationships are based on financial need, and this need takes front seat to moral concerns. \u000aTransformación de Lazarillo: En el Lazarillo, vemos al niño madurarse. Por medio de su contacto con sus amos, se da cuenta que en el mundo las apariencias engañan: los curas no son buenos y los ricos son pobres. Ve también la decadencia moral. Por eso, al final, no le importa ser cornudo. Lo único que importa es su propio bienestar. \u000aSociedades en contacto: Lazarillo narra su historia a "vuestra merced", una persona de rango social muy superior al suyo. La novela claramente revela la diversidad de la España imperial: Lazarillo es hijo de moro y cristiana; la madre se amanceba con un negro y su hermanastro es mulato, etc. La novela es una mina de discursos sobre la raza. \u000aCreación literaria: Lázaro cuenta la historia de su vida a un tal "vuestra merced". Nosotros, los lectores, no somos los destinatarios del mensaje; solo escuchamos a hurtadillas. La narratología llama "narratario" al personaje a quien se dirige el narrador \u2014un concepto crítico muy moderno. Como toda narración en primera persona, el lector se da cuenta de que es un relato sumamente subjetivo, puesto que el narrador nos pinta la realidad desde su perspectiva y no hay la posibilidad de ver otro punto de vista. También, de esta manera, nos puede contar lo que él quiera. Esto se observa muy patentemente al final del cuarto tratado, cuando Lazarillo escribe: "por otras cosillas que no digo". ¿Qué puede haber pasado con el fraile que Lazarillo no puede contar a su destinatario? \u000aDualidad del ser: Lazarillo es el narrador de su novela, así como el personaje principal de ella. Visto de este modo, Lazarillo se desdobla en dos seres: uno real y otro ficticio. Pero como en "Borges y yo" el personaje y el autor se fusionan y no se puede distinguir el uno del otro. Otros personajes se ponen máscaras: el escudero aparenta ser de cierta categoría social, aunque vive en la pobreza, y los sacerdotes, que supuestamente deben ser ejemplos de moralidad, infringen las leyes morales

sVThe Plain Truth Fallacy
p34103
VA fallacy of logos favoring familiar or easily comprehensible data, examples and evidence over that which is more complex and unfamiliar but much closer to the truth. E.g, "Ooooh, look at all those equations and formulas! Just boil it down to the Simple Truth," or "I don't want your damned philosophy lesson! Just tell me the Plain Truth about why this is happening." A more sophisticated version of this fallacy arbitrarily proposes, as did 18th century Scottish rhetorician John Campbell, that the Truth is always simple by nature and only malicious enemies of the Truth would ever seek to make it complicated. (See also, The Snow Job, and Overexplanation.) The opposite of this is the postmodern fallacy of Ineffability or Complexity, arbitrarily declaring that today's world is so complex that there is no truth, or that Truth (capital-T), if indeed such a thing exists, is unknowable except perhaps by God and is thus forever inaccessible and irrelevant to us mere finite mortals, making any cogent argument from logos impossible. See also the Paralysis of Analysis, and Overexplanation.

p36855
VThe goal of argumentative writing is to persuade an audience that one's ideas are valid, or more\u000avalid than someone else's. The Greek philosopher Aristotle divided all means of persuasion (appeals) into three categories - ethos, pathos, and logos.\u000a\u000aEthos (credibility) means being convinced by the credibility of the author. We tend to believe people whom we respect. In an appeal to ethos, a writer tries to convince the audience the he or she someone worth listening to, in other words an authority on the subject, as well as someone who is likable and worthy of respect. (Also see the fallacy of appeal to authority.) An argument that relies too heavily on ethos, without any corroborating logos, can become a fallacy.\u000a\u000aPathos (emotional) means persuading by appealing to the reader's emotions. (Also see the fallacy of appeal to emotion). An argument that relies too much on emotion, without any corroborating logos, can become a fallacy. \u000a\u000aLogos (logical) means persuading by the use of reasoning, using true premises and valid arguments. This is generally considered the strongest form of persuasion.

VThe sensory details or figurative language used to describe, arouse emotion, or represent abstractions.

On a broader and deeper level, however, one image can represent more than one thing. For example, a rose may present visual imagery while also representing the color in a woman's cheeks and/or symbolizing some degree of perfection. An author may use complex imagery while simultaneously employing other figure s of speech, especially metaphor and simile. In addition, this term can apply to the total of all the images in a work. On the AP exam, pay attention to how an author creates imagery and to the effect of this imagery.

VThis corrupt modern argument from ethos argues to a less-educated or rural audience that the one arguing is "just plain folks" who is a "plain talker," "says what s/he is thinking," and thinks like the audience, and is thus worthy of belief, unlike some "double-domed professor," "Washington bureaucrat," "tree-hugger" or other despised outsider who "doesn't think like we do" or "doesn't share our traditional values." This is a counterpart to the Ad Hominem Fallacy and occasionally carries a distinct flavor of xenophobia or racism as well. This also includes the fallacy that "We're just plain folks so we need to keep our heads down and not get involved in the big things of this world, like politics, demonstrations or protests." See also the Plain Truth Fallacy.

VAn ancient, extremely dangerous fallacy (a deluded argument from ethos) asserting that God (or History, or a higher power) has ordered or anointed, supports or approves of one's own standpoint or actions so no further justification is required and no serious challenge is possible. (E.g., "God ordered me to kill my children," or "We need to take away your land, since God [or Manifest Destiny, or Fate, or Heaven] has given it to us as our own.") A private individual who seriously asserts this fallacy risks ending up in a psychiatric ward, but groups or nations who do it are far too often taken seriously. This vicious fallacy has been the cause of endless bloodshed over history. See also, Magical Thinking. Also applies to deluded negative Appeals to Heaven, e.g., "You say that climate change and ecological collapse is a real danger, but I know God wouldn't ever let that happen!" The opposite of the Appeal to Heaven is the Job's Comforter fallacy.

VMacbeth's wife, a deeply ambitious woman who lusts for power and position. Early in the play she seems to be the stronger and more ruthless of the two, as she urges her husband to kill Duncan and seize the crown. After the bloodshed begins, however, Lady Macbeth falls victim to guilt and madness to an even greater degree than her husband. Her conscience affects her to such an extent that she eventually commits suicide. At the beginning of the play, Macbeth and Lady Macbeth apparently feel quite passionately for one another, and Lady Macbeth exploits her sexual hold over Macbeth as a means to persuade him to commit murder. However, their shared alienation from the world, occasioned by their partnership in crime, does not bring them closer together, but instead seems to numb their feelings for one another.

Poetry can be divided into lyric, dramatic, narrative, epic, etc. Drama can be divided into tragedy, comedy, melodrama, farce, etc. Homily (hom-uh-lee)- This term literally means "sermon," but more informally, it can include any serious talk, speech, or lecture involving moral or spiritual advice.

sVPlaying on Emotion
p40429
VThe classic fallacy of pure argument from pathos, ignoring facts and calling on emotion alone. E.g., "If you don't agree that witchcraft is a major problem just shut up, close your eyes for a moment and picture in your mind all those poor moms crying bitter tears for their innocent tiny children whose cozy little beds and happy tricycles lie all cold and abandoned, just because of those wicked old witches! Let's string'em all up!" The opposite of this is the archly cynical Apathetic Fallacy, where any and all legitimate arguments from pathos are brushed aside because, in the words of country music singer Jo Dee Messina, "My give a damn is busted." Also associated with the Pathetic Fallacy is the fallacy of Refinement ("Real Feelings"), where certain classes of living beings such as plants and animals, infants, babies and minor children, slaves, deep-sea sailors, farmworkers, criminals and convicts, refugees, addicts, terrorists, foreigners, the poor, or "the lower classes" in general are deemed incapable of experiencing real pain like we do, or of having any "real feelings" at all, only brutish appetites, filthy lusts, animal instincts, drives, cravings and automatic tropisms.

sVMire los muros de la patria mia; Francisco Quevedo
p40501
VGénero: Poesía del Siglo de Oro - Soneto \u000aSiglo: XVII \u000aMovimiento: Barroco - Conceptismo \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aQuevedo's "Miré los muros de la patria mía" also deals with the passage of time and its destructive effects, but with a much more serious topic: the declining power of Spain. The seventeenth century saw Spain's power within Europe decline dramatically, and while its arts flourished like never before, the signs of social and moral decay were evidenced everywhere. And Quevedo depicts that decadence and decay in the Baroque subtext of his famous sonnet. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE.\u000aEstado de la patria: Desmoronadas (arruinadas). \u2022 Decadencia, fin de su potencia. \u000aHipérbatos (2nda estrofa): Impresión negativa: el sequío, ganados sin orden y bramando (¿símbolo de un pueblo insatisfecho?), oscuridad, etc. \u000aTema: Memento mori (recuerdo de que todo termina en la muerte). \u000aMovt. del espacio: Miré, salí, entré, sentí. \u000aEspacio público(nación) a privado \u2192 entra en su propia casa. \u000aSimbolismo: La espada vencida es otro símbolo de la decadencia de España. \u000aDiscurso religioso: "báculo , más corvo y menos fuerte" --> Un pueblo que ha perdido su fe. Posiblemente la defensa y diseminación de la religión católica había sido el motivo principal de la política exterior e interior de España, pero ahora se ha perdido ese ahínco\u000aGradación: This term is not used in English. It refers to a series of words that are placed intentionally in the order of a musical scale, either up or down. The Góngora poem ends in a famous example of gradación descendente: "en tierra, en humo, en polvo, en sombra, en nada." \u000aRetruécano: This refers to a play on words. Some of these can be very simple, but in Baroque poetry they can, as expected, be highly complex. A good example is Quevedo's use of the adjective "desmoronados" in the second line of his sonnet. He is obviously referring to the crumbling fortifications of his patria\u2014a fitting symbol of the decline of Spanish military power. However, those fortifications were originally built to protect the villages from Moorish attacks. Thus, they have a relationship to the Reconquista, which attempted to rid the country of Moors. The neologism desmoronar (to "unmoor" the country) is masterful. \u000aPolisíndeton: The example above under gradación is also an example of polysyndeton, where words\u2014usually prepositions or articles\u2014are repeated unnecessarily for aural effect. Góngora could just as easily have said "en tierra, humo, polvo y nada."\u000aQuevedo usa el estilo Barroco en "Miré los muros de la patria mía" no para jugar con un tema latino como el carpe diem, sino para expresar la decadencia militar de España

The subtle irony is that a single woman is in want of a rich husband as manifested by the evidence in the novel that follows this opening line.\u000aSarcasm: a type of verbal irony that is crude and blatant praise or dispraise. Example: "Oh, you're God's great gift to women, you are!"

sVEl Sur; Jorge Luis Borges
p42101
VGénero: Prosa - Cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom Latinoamericano\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aVarias generaciones de la familia de Borges eran militares. Borges, sin embargo, era un intelectual en vez de un hombre de acción. Trabajo como bibliotecario, y él cuenta que un día se golpeó la cabeza con el marco de una ventana recién pintada y que sufrió un a septicemia que casi lo llevó a la muerte. Fue a raíz de este percance que Borges empezó a escribir relatos. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTiempo y espacio: Antes del siglo XX , el tiempo era sobre todo lineal , pero con los avances de la ciencia ( la relatividad , en particular ) y la psicología , se hizo evidente que había muchas formas de tiempo , uno de ellos el tiempo psicológico . Mientras nosotros podemos pensar que vivimos en el tiempo cronológico , estamos constantemente viajando de ida y vuelta con nuestros recuerdos y nuestros sueños y aspiraciones . Un segundo en tiempo real , cronológico puede ser un corto período de tiempo , mientras que en la mente , toda una vida puede ser condensada en espacio corto . Esto es lo que ocurre con Dahlamnn ; lo más probable es que muere en la Mesa de operaciones , pero en el corto segundos antes de su muerte , se imagina otra muerte - uno\u000amás romántico y Argentina , a pesar de su aburrido trabajo de biblioteca y su herencia germánica. \u000aEn Borges el espacio y el tiempo se funden. El mundo urbano de Buenos Aires se convierte en la pampa argentina. El tiempo linear de la enfermedad se convierte en tiempo psicológico. No se distingue fácilmente entre un tiempo y otro, o entre un espacio real (Buenos Aires) y otro imaginario (la pampa argentina). \u000aSanatorio: Se dio con la punta de una ventana abierta recién pintada y le dio una septicemia y lo llevan a un sanatorio. Sensaciones extrañas: Todo sabe mal; por la fiebre ve los dibujos de Las mil y una noches en sus sueños; cree que está en el infierno; lo llevan a otro sanatorio para hacerle una radiografía, pero lo que siente es un pinchazo para la anestesia; etc. \u000aDahlmann en su viaje al sur: Se siente desdoblado \u2014como una persona que viaja y otra estancada en el sanatorio; el tren para en medio del campo donde no hay nada y tiene que caminar diez o doce cuadras para conseguir un carro; etc. \u2022 Unos chicos se burlan de él, tirándole miguitas de pan en el almacén. El dueño lo reconoce y un gaucho viejo le tira una navaja. El protagonista tiene que pelear porque es cuestión de reputación y honor. Siente que va a morir, pero es una muerte preferida a la de la septicemia. \u000aNarrador: Omnisciente. \u2022 Parece que la acción ocurre en la mente de Dahlmann, con algún orden cronológico pero no en el tiempo o espacio normal.\u000aClimax: Se dice que elige una muerte romántica, que es exactamente lo que pasa. El lector no se da cuenta en ese momento. La atención del lector va en busca de detalles que no tienen que ver con la acción, ya que sabe el clímax. \u000aEspacio psíquico & físico: Las cosas que ve desde el tren parecen "sueños de la llanura". El vagón en que viaja no es el mismo que tomó en Buenos Aires, etc. \u2022 "Viajaba al pasado y no sólo al sur". Aquí mezcla tiempo y espacio. Los dos se esfuminan en uno solo. \u000aEspacios temporales binarios: Las dos descendencias opuestas; la metrópoli y el campo; la muerte en el sanatorio y la muerte en una pelea de navajas; etc. \u000aMuerte: Hay varias posibilidades: cuando se hizo daño con la ventana pintada; en la cama cuando todo le sabe atroz; cuando lo mandan para una radiografía; cuando le pinchan para anestesiarlo; cuando le dan la baja del sanatorio; etc. No se puede estar totalmente seguro. \u000aInferencia:El propósito de Borges es precisamente confrontar al lector con dilemas complejas de tiempos y espacios \u000apara involucrarlo en la lectura. \u000aDos planos temporales: Uno, a raíz del accidente y dos, en un mini segundo de su mente cuando se imagina una muerte romántica. \u000aTiempo:Circular: Dahlmann vuelve a la estancia de su familia; futuro: el cuento prefigura su muerte, anunciando así un hecho futuro, y al final sale a la llanura pero no se dice que muere; pasado: viaja desde el centro de Buenos Aires a los barrios antiguos y desde allí al mundo gauchesco aún más antiguo

sVThe Excluded Middle
p42209
VA corrupted argument from logos that proposes that since a little of something is good, more must be better (or that if less of something is good, none at all is even better). E.g., "If eating an apple a day is good for you, eating an all-apple diet is even better!" or "If a low fat diet prolongs your life, a zero-fat diet should make you live forever!" An opposite of this fallacy is that of Excluded Outliers, where one arbitrarily dismisses examples or results that disprove one's standpoint by simply describing them as "Weird," "Outliers," or "Atypical." Also opposite is the fallacy of the Middle Path, where one demonstrates the "reasonableness" of one's own standpoint (no matter how extreme) not on its own merits, but by presenting it as the "moderate" path between two obviously unacceptable alternatives. E.g. Lenin successfully argued for Bolshevism as the only available "moderate" middle path between bomb-throwing Nihilist terrorists on the ultraleft and a corrupt and hated Czarist autocracy on the right.

sVThe Appeal to Pity
p42497
VThe fallacy of urging an audience to "root for the underdog" regardless of the issues at hand. A classic example is, "Those poor, cute little squeaky mice are being gobbled up by mean, nasty cats ten times their size!" A contemporary example might be America's uncritical popular support for the Arab Spring movement of 2010-2012 in which The People ("The underdogs") were seen to be heroically overthrowing cruel dictatorships, a movement that has resulted in retrospect in chaos, anarchy, mass suffering, the rise of extremism, and the largest refugee crisis in Europe since World War II. A corrupt argument from pathos. See also, Playing to Emotions. The opposite of the Appeal to Pity is the Appeal to Rigor, an argument (often based on machismo or on manipulating an audience's fear) based on mercilessness. E.g., "I'm a real man, not like those bleeding hearts, and I'll be tough on [fill in the name of the enemy or bogeyman of the hour]." In academia this latter fallacy applies to politically-motivated or elitist calls for "Academic Rigor" and against Open Admissions, "Dumbing Down" and "Grade Inflation."

sVBalada de los abuelos; Nicolas Guillen
p42859
VGénero: Poesía negra ( verso libre)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: La Vanguardia hispanoamericana \u000aContexto histórico:\u000a**La presencia española en la región del Caribe arrasó la población autóctona con enfermedades, guerra, y labor forzado. Para sustituir la mano de obra desaparecida, los españoles importaron a esclavos africanos para el arduo trabajo de la cosecha de la caña de azúcar. La presencia africana dio lugar a un mestizaje entre blancos y negros. Uno de los objetivos de la Revolución Cubana de 1959 que trajo Fidel Castro al poder fue la eliminación total del racismo en Cuba. No se sabe si se ha conseguido esta intención pero Nicolás Guillén, como el poeta nacional de la Revolución, abrazó sus metas. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDualidad de la identidad: la doble herencia étnica del mundo hispánico. El tema de la raza y mezclas raciales, que caracteriza gran parte de América Latina , constituye la base de este poema . Entonces, se ajusta a los conceptos organizadores de "asimilación " y " diversidad"\u000aSignos: abuelo blanco/abuelo negro: Abuelo negro: lanza, tambor, pie desnudo, torso pétreo, selvas húmedas, gongos, buques de esclavos (velas, galeón); abuelo blanco: gorguera, armadura, ojos azules, aguaprieta de caimanes, mañanas de coco, costas vírgenes, abalorios. \u000aVoces de los abuelos: El abuelo negro dice "me muero"; El abuelo blanco dice "me canso". Uno es mucho más fuerte y desesperante. \u2022 El blanco grita, el negro calla. Uno manda porque tiene poder, el otro no tiene más remedio que obedecer. \u000a"Fuerte voz/despedazando el silencio" (verso 41-42)": la voz de los negreros. \u000aLos dos abuelos (en común): Es la ley del universo ("bajo las estrellas") que todos los hombres son iguales: sueñan, son del mismo tamaño, tienen el mismo orgullo, la misma esperanza, etc. "Abrazar" (verso 53) significa también "comprender", "contener", "incluir". \u000aVisión de esperanza: Los dos se abrazan; el poema termina con "cantan", lo cual simboliza la armonía.\u000aForma métrica: Verso octosílabo; patrón de rima: Asonancia en e/o, pero hay varios patrones. \u000aVerso libre: No tiene un número fijo de sílabas ni una rima fija. Sin embargo, la mayoría es octosílaba, de modo que se acerca al verso blanco. \u000aSimbolismos: "escoltar" Es un verbo más fuerte; implica protección, seguridad, así como honrar al que se lleva. Signos de la Conquista: Gorguera y la armadura guerrera. \u2022 Los galeones ardiendo en oro, las costas vírgenes, etc. "Abalorio"- abuelo blanco (verso 26): Es algo de poco valor. Los españoles vinieron para enriquecerse con el oro, pero muchos no lograron su sueño. \u000aEl abuelo negro : (verso 38) Los latigazos sangran; los ojos, como las venas, están entreabiertos por el cansancio. \u2022 Llora y sangra porque sufre. Tiene los ojos pegados porque no puede descansar; siempre tiene que trabajar. \u2022 La Madrugada (verso 39) - algo positivo, el comienzo de un nuevo día. Para el negro no hay la posibilidad de un nuevo día, y por eso se subvierte la imagen positiva en negativa\u000a"Atardeceres de ingenio"- Los esclavos, después de cortar caña todo el día, por la noche lo procesaban en el ingenio. O sea, Guillén crea una bella yuxtaposición entre "madrugada" y "atardecer", ambos con significantes aflictivos. El esclavo no tiene descanso.\u000aGradación poética: Es como el final de una sinfonía que, en vez de llegar a un crescendo, se va disminuyendo el sonido. \u2022 Da a entender que en Cuba hay (o habrá) una armonía entre las razas por medio del mestizaje. \u000aFiguras retóricas auditivas: \u000aAliteración: "gordos gongos sordos"\u000aEufonía: "bajo las estrellas altas"\u000aAnáfora: "Qué de barcos" \u000aAnadiplosis: "cantan / cantan".

sVThe Appeal to Closure
p43315
VThe contemporary fallacy that an argument, standpoint, action or conclusion no matter how questionable must be accepted as final or else the point will remain unsettled, which is unthinkable because those affected will be denied "closure." This fallacy falsely reifies a specialized term from Gestalt Psychology (closure) while refusing to recognize the undeniable truth that some points will indeed remain unsettled, perhaps forever. E.g., "Society would be protected, crime would be deterred and justice served if we sentence you to life without parole, but we need to execute you in order to provide some closure." See also, Argument from Ignorance, and Argument from Consequences. The opposite of this fallacy is Paralysis of Analysis.

p44039
VGénero: novela moderna\u000aSiglo:XVII\u000aMovimiento: Siglo de Oro- Barroco \u000aContexto histórico:\u000a En Don Quijote se ve un caso irónico de ayuda al individuo que resulta perjudicado. La ayuda que don Quijote le ofrece a Andrés \u2014un acto totalmente altruista\u2014 resulta en un mayor castigo para el pobre chico. Aquí se ve el desengaño profundo que se expresa en la novela y que caracteriza todo el arte Barroco. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTransformación de los protagonistas (Parte 2): Los críticos han comentado de la "sanchificación" de don Quijote y la "quijotización" de Sancho. O sea, los dos se van transformando a lo largo de la novela a causa de la influencia del uno al otro. Sancho se hace más idealista y don Quijote más realista. Esto se observa claramente en el último capítulo cuando don Quijote vuelve a la razón pero Sancho quiere volver a las andanzas caballerescas. \u000aDualidad del ser: Don Quijote is another iconic example of the displacement of the self. Alonso Quijano (or whatever his name might be, for it keeps changing) constructs an ideal world in which knights corrected wrongs and fought injustice. He transforms himself into one of those knights and sets out to change the world. The greatness of Cervantes's novel is that the real man and his fictitious creation are fused to the extent that the reader seldom knows if the protagonist's actions are real or not. This point is driven home in Chapter V, when a neighbor tries to tell don Quixote that he's actually Alonso Quijana, and don Quixote responds: "Yo sé quien soy, y sé que puedo ser no solo los que he dicho, sino todos los doce Pares de Francia." \u000aRealidad y fantasía: Don Quijote plantea en la literatura occidental una pregunta fundamental y universal: ¿Qué es la realidad? A lo largo de la obra, se le da vueltas constantes a ese dilema. Don Quijote altera la realidad para sus propias necesidades: cuando está cansado transforma una venta en castillo; cuando tiene que impresionar a Sancho transforma los molinos de viento en gigantes. Cuando su escudero le recuerda que eran molinos de viento, el caballero le da la razón, pero dice que fueron sus enemigos (los malignos encantadores) quienes transformaron los gigantes en molinos, etc. Siguiendo las ideas de Platón, las cosas están en un constante estado de cambio: una silla puede ser un trono para un rey o una escalera para alguien que necesite encaramarse. Como resultado, no es fácil fijar la realidad; todo depende del punto de mira de cada individuo y el contexto en el cual existe. \u000aMetaliteratura: \u000a El narrador dice que no importa el nombre exacto del héroe. \u2022 El autor implícito no es el único que no ha visto sobre Es autoconsciente; hay un discurso metaliterario; el autor se basa en fuentes de información \u2014don Quijote no es simplemente fruto de su creatividad.\u000aLos nombres: No se pueden identificar; se convierten en genérico. Cuando reciben nombre tienen una identidad específica. Los nombres exactos no importan. Pero más profundo es la noción de que es imposible saber lo que es la realidad exacta. La expresión "conjeturas verosímiles" es una paradoja. \u000aSociedades en contacto: En DQ se observan varias estradas sociales: labradores, prostitutas, arrieros (moriscos), mercaderes de seda (conversos), nobles (la dama camino al Nuevo Mundo), etc. \u2022 Construcción del género: Don Quijote protege a las mujeres y las trata con respeto, algo que los hombres de su época a lo mejor no hacían. Esto se ve en su trato con las prostitutas de la venta.\u000a Tiempo y espacio: Don Quijote revive otros tiempos y espacios que no son los suyos. Intenta recrear un momento idílico, aunque ficticio, en que la bondad reinaba. También, don Quijote viaja por un espacio real: Castilla, con sus ventas, molinos de viento y ciudades. \u000aRelaciones interpersonales: Aquí se destaca la íntima relación que se establece entre don Quijote y Sancho. También, hay momentos conmovedores de humanidad: el respeto que le da don Quijote a las prostitutas, la defensa a Andrés y el vecino (Pedro Alonso) que ayuda a don Quijote y lo lleva a su casa. Dualidad del ser: Claramente, don Quijote se inventa otro "ser" y vive entre ser Alonso Quijano y don Quijote. En la escena con Pedro Alonso, don Quijote dice "Sé quien soy. Y puedo ser el que quiera". O sea, sabe que hace un papel que él mismo ha elegido. \u000aCreación literaria: Aquí la novela ofrece una mina. En primer lugar, tenemos el intertexto de las novelas de caballería. Luego vemos a Alonso Quijano crearse en el personaje de don Quijote (nombrándose, eligiendo una dama, etc.) así como el autor crea un personaje ficticio. Según el autor implícito, basa su novela en documentos de los archivos de la Mancha. Cuando ya no hay más información, se descubre el manuscrito en árabe de Cide Hamete Benengeli, que el autor implícito hace traducir al castellano y de ahí basa su novela. Todo esto nos hace reflexionar sobre la creación literaria y a la misma vez pone en tela de juicio la veracidad de los textos históricos: ¿Se puede confiar en una traducción no profesional del árabe al castellano hecha por un moro?

p44071
VThe contemporary ethical fallacy that one's consistently moral life, good behavior or recent extreme suffering or sacrifice earns him/her the right to commit an immoral act without repercussions, consequences or punishment. E.g., "I've been good all year, so one bad won't matter," or "After what I've been through, God knows I need this." The fallacy of Moral Licensing is also sometimes applied to nations, e.g., "Those who criticize repression and the Gulag in the former USSR forget what extraordinary suffering the Russians went through in World War II and the millions upon millions who died." See also Argument from Motives. The opposite of this fallacy is the (excessively rare in our times) ethical fallacy of Scruples, in which one obsesses to pathological excess about one's accidental, forgotten, unconfessed or unforgiven sins and because of them, the seemingly inevitable prospect of eternal damnation.

sVLa noche boca arriba; Julio Cortazar
p44121
VGénero: Prosa ( Cuento, realismo mágico) \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: El boom latinoamericano \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aLos aztecas para aplacar a los dioses, practicaban el sacrificio humano. Para ello cazaban a miembros de tribus enemigas, los traían vivos a Tenochtitlan donde los llevaban a la cima de una pirámide, les extraían el corazón y luego quemaba los órganos en ofrenda a los dioses. La lucha para conseguir seres para sacrificar se llamaba la guerra florida. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aDualidad del ser /existencia: En "La noche boca arriba " se produce una bifurcación similar que en los cuentos "El sur" de Borges. El conductor de la motocicleta , en su lecho de muerte , vuelve a crear otro espacio y se imagina siendo perseguido por los indios Moteca para ser sacrificado . El juego , al final, revela que en realidad fue el moteca que estaba recreando otro espacio con avenidas , edificios altos , ambulancias, y motocicletas. La historia ha sido leída como abarcando las dos caras de la identidad de América Latina: el europeo y el indígena. Si bien un análisis histórico típico mira hacia el pasado indígena de México, en esta historia el pasado mira hacia el futuro.\u000aTiempo y espacio: \u000aDe manera similar, Cortázar , en "La noche boca arriba ", también juega con el tiempo y el espacio,\u000apero de una manera diferente. Aquí el paciente moribundo se mueve entre dos mundos : uno que nosotros los lectores como propio , y el otro es el mundo extraño de los aztecas. En el mundo moderno el protagonista está convaleciente después de una operación , y en el otro reino está siendo perseguido por los indígenas como sacrificios humano para los dioses. En ambas realidades el se enfrenta a la muerte. El ingenioso juego con el tiempo y el espacio, sin embargo, es que el mundo contemporáneo que el lector ha imaginado como el escenario de la historia es en realidad el tiempo y el espacio que está siendo imaginado por el moribundo moteca a punto de ser sacrificado . Al igual que en Borges , Cortázar representa el tiempo como un constructo inestable ligada a puntos de vista individuales\u000aSignos tiempo moderno/pasado:\u000aModerno: avenidas, autos, motos, edificios, ambulancias, hospitales, etc.; Pasado: pantano, bosque, calzada, puñal, etc. \u000a\u2022 El lector reconoce el tiempo moderno y sobrecoge porque no tiene lugar en nuestro tiempo, sino en el tiempo pasado. Nuestro presente es imaginado por el moteca desde el pasado. Como lectores siempre lo vemos desde nuestro punto de vista y nuestra realidad. Nos sorprende cuando descubrimos otra perspectiva completamente distinta a la nuestra. \u000aSinécdoque: "El hombre de blanco"= el cirujano; Metonimia: "algo que ...brillaba en la mano" =la cuchilla\u000aTropos: "Sus pies se hundían en un colchón de hojas y barro"; "Como si el cielo se encendiera en el horizonte, vio antorchas moviéndose entre las ramas"; una lámpara violeta en la pared del hospital era "como un ojo protector"; la moto es "un enorme insecto de metal"; etc. \u000aLos sentidos: Hay mucha referencia al olor, el sabor, el tacto, etc. \u2022 Con frecuencia, el olor transporta al protagonista de un mundo al otro. \u000aParalelismos mundo moderno/mundo azteca: \u000aEl camino por el paseo en moto = la calzada por la cual corre el moteca; \u000aEl grito de la mujer que causó el accidente=el grito que da el moteca cuando lo van a matar\u000aEl hombre transportado a la ambulancia en una camilla boca arriba= el moteca atado a la camilla que lo transporta al templo\u000aOlores del hospital = olor a guerra y muchos otros olores que siente en su fuga \u000aEl brazo restringido por yeso y el aparato con pesas=las sogas con las que lo atan al ser capturado \u000aEl cirujano con el cuchillo en la mano= el cuchillo de piedra sangriento que lleva el sacrificador azteca \u000aLa moto ronroneando sobre las piernas del motociclista="el insecto de metal que zumbaba bajo sus piernas"

Somebody with deep pockets is gonna pay for this!"), though often scapegoating is cynically used to shield those truly responsible from blame. A particularly corrupt and cynical example of this is Blaming the Victim, in which one falsely casts the blame for one's own evil or questionable actions on those affected, e.g., "If you move an eyelash I'll have to kill you and you'll be to blame!" or "You bi**h, you dressed immodestly and made me rape you! Then you went and snitched on me and now I'm going to prison, and it's all your fault!" See also, the Affective Fallacy.

sVEl Ahogado mas Hermoso del Mundo; Gabriel Garcia Marquez
p46661
VGénero: Narrativa- cuento\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom-Realismo mágico\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aSe encuentra en el ámbito del Realismo mágico. Al igual que en otras historias de su (por ejemplo , "Un señor muy viejo con Unas Alas Enormes "), una figura inesperada invade el espacio de alguien y provoca una transformación. La "magia " viene del hecho de que el invasor no es una figura reconocible, y el "Realismo " es que las personas afectadas no están del todo sorprendidas por la presencia del objeto desconocido. Estas apariciones mágicas parecen representar algo, aunque\u000alo que representan nunca es explícito. Claramente , sin embargo , tienen un poder transformador. El ahogado trae un \u000anuevo entusiasmo y creatividad para el pueblo , y los residentes son por lo tanto capaces de escapar de su insularidad.\u000aNarrador: Omnisciente, objetivo. Solo describe; no interpreta. Es capaz de saber todo lo que está pensando la gente del pueblo. \u2022 No hay asombro ante los hechos poco probables y 'mágicos'. Hay un discurso indirecto libre ya que incluye las citas directamente como parte de su narración, sin separarlos con puntuación. \u000aAmbiente: Es un pueblo árido, pobre, escuálido. \u2022 Monótono, aburrido. \u2022 Forma un contraste destacado con todo lo que representa Esteban: belleza, virilidad, grandeza, nuevas posibilidades, etc.\u000aTransformación de Esteban: Después de quitarle las algas, ven que es un hombre, pero muy diferente de los hombres del pueblo. Va cobrando más y más importancia y creando cada vez más carácter mítico y de grandeza en su imaginación. \u2022 Lo personalizan; lo hacen parte de sus vidas. Puede simbolizar que los casos inesperados y milagrosos que pasan en la vida tienen la capacidad de transformarla. \u000aProtagonista colectivo: Es universal; puede referirse a cualquiera. \u000aHipérbole: La inmensidad del cadáver y todas las molestias que presenta. La hipérbole es la base del relato. Todo se exagera, y la exageración va creciendo, paso a paso, hasta terminar en su conversión en el salvador del pueblo. O sea, un hombre ahogado termina siendo un ser mítico que transforma todo un pueblo. También provoca mucho humor. \u000aSigno Indeterminado: Puede representar muchas cosas, pero nada concreto. \u000aAhogado: Da al pueblo tedioso algo diferente e interesante. El pueblo nunca será igual después del contacto con Esteban. Aunque el signo no es concreto, el efecto que produce es muy positivo.

p46735
VGénero: Ensayo\u000aSiglo: XIX\u000aMovimiento: Modernismo\u000aContexto histórico: \u000a*José Martí fue precursor del Modernismo en Latinoamérica.\u000a*Esta obra maestra muestra , a pesar de su dificultad, las divisiones dentro de la sociedad de América Latina - política, social y racialmente . El autor demanda que los latinoamericanos miren a su propia realidad multiétnica y no a Europa para los modelos de gobierno. Por otra parte , esta obra pertenece de lleno en el concepto organizador del imperialismo ", ya que Martí advierte de los peligros potenciales de la participación de EE.UU. en los asuntos de América Latina. \u000aHace referencia a los muchos conflictos que resultaron en Hispanoamérica a raíz de la independencia. Entre estos conflictos entre países vecinos, se destacan la Guerra de la Triple Alianza contra Paraguay y, en este caso, la Guerra del Pacífico, entre Chile, Perú y Bolivia, en que Chile le quitó a Bolivia su única salida al mar así como un territorio rico en recursos naturales.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a*Martí escribe explícitamente del efecto pernicioso del racismo en Hispanoamérica. \u000a*Martí no habla de asimilación, sino de hermandad entre los pueblos y las razas, lo cual equivale a una forma de asimilación. \u000a*Martí aspira a los valores más altos del ser humano: justicia, amor, hermandad, igualdad social, dignidad, fortaleza, etc\u000a*Martí apela en este ensayo por la creación de un gobierno y una sociedad que refleje la realidad histórica particular de la región y no de uno que sea imitación del mundo europeo, que él piensa es muy distinto. \u2022 Que en las universidades, en vez de solo aprender la historia europea, que se aprenda la historia hispanoamericana así como otras materias que puedan contribuir al desarrollo del continente. \u000a*Martí no sugiere un plan específico para resolver los problemas. Lo único concreto es que no se puede importar ideas. También confía en la bondad del hombre para resolver los problemas.\u000a*Él dice que el indio y el negro han sido ignorados por completo por los criollos y que esto no puede ser. Hay que aceptar a Hispanoamérica como un mundo muy pluralista, y sus gobiernos tienen que incluir a todos. Otra vez aconseja abandonar los modelos europeos para resolver los problemas de América. \u000a**Martí no emplea el estilo directo del ensayo si no que emplea muchos elementos de la poesía: \u000aAudiencia: A pesar de su mensaje a favor del hombre natural, este ensayo es muy cosmopolita, como la mayoría de las obras modernistas, en el sentido de que se dirige a un grupo muy selecto de personas educadas y bien informadas, capaces de entender sus códigos y tropos\u000aAliteración:"la tundan y talen las tempestades" contiene la repetición de los sonidos dentales de t/d)\u000aMetáfora: "no podemos ser el pueblo de hojas, que vive en el aire, con la copa cargada de flor, restallando o zumbando" o sea, el pueblo es un árbol.\u000aSímbolo: "los gigantes que llevan siete leguas en las botas" representan las amenazas que el pueblo ignora, quizá la potencia de los Estados Unidos)\u000aPolisíndeton: o/o/ e y/y en la primera oración; símil: "una idea enérgica, flamea . . . como la bandera mística del juicio final". \u000aTropos y perifrasis: \u000a'El aldeano': los hispanoamericanos que no conocen más que su propio mundillo y se creen el dueño de él \u000a'Los que enseñan los puños': los que quieren luchar para quitarle territorio a sus vecinos \u000aLos 'sietemesinos': hombres inmaduros, impacientes y egoístas que lo quieren todo rápidamente sin llegar a los nueve meses para un nacimiento normal \u000a'La pelea del libro con el cirial': la lucha entre la razón y las creencias religiosas \u000a'Hombre natural': El natural es el hombre puro que vive, labora, produce, goza, sufre y muere. El otro es el falso, que por tener una educación se siente superior sin producir nada beneficioso. \u000a e l 'tigre': los Estados Unidos \u000a'Las charretas y togas', 'alpargatas' y 'vinchas': la diferencia entre lo importado de Europa y lo autóctono; prendas de lujo en contraste con prendas de trabajo\u000aEl 'vecino formidable': los Estados Unidos \u000aEl 'pueblo rubio': los Estados Unidos

sVLa Casa de Bernarda Alba; Federico Garcia Lorca
p47423
VGénero: Teatro (drama moderno)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardia\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aCostumbres tradicionales en unos pueblos de España e Hispanoamérica es que la familia debe guardar el luto durante 7 años después de la muerte de un familiar cercano. Durante este periodo, todos se visten de negro. La hija mayor debe casarse antes de que puedan casarse las más jóvenes. Los novios se cortejan desde los balcones, cuyas rejas permiten hablar pero poco más. Las mujeres de la familia preparan el ajuar de la novia, haciendo ropa de cama y mantelería que bordan a mano. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a La continuidad de la tradición: Se debe notar que Lorca crítica esta tradición. El aborda el tema con mayor complejidad y profundidad, al ser una mujer (Bernarda Alba) la que impone \u2014de un modo intransigente\u2014 la tradición. \u000aFeminismo: Sin embargo, las viejas costumbres y la moralidad todavía oprimen a las mujeres, como se ve claramente en La casa de Bernarda Alba. \u000aActo I: Las mujeres tienen que comportarse de una manera determinada por la tradición. Esto incluye la obediencia a los padres y a los esposos, el comportamiento moral, la virginidad, etc. \u000aSimbolismo: \u000aLas manchas: la limpieza que exige Bernarda forma un paralelo con la pureza que espera de sus hijas; hay que notar que las manchas no salen; \u000aEl bastón de Bernarda: su autoridad; es fálico y ella hace el papel del hombre en esta pieza;\u000aVestido verde de Adela: el color de la naturaleza \u2014ella quiere liberarse; \u000aEncierro de Josefa: no permitir que las mujeres tengan una vida propia \u2014están encerradas por la tradición. \u000aActo II: \u000aProblemática central: Pepe y Adela han entablado relaciones. \u000aSimbolismo: acto de bordar con aguja- Reproduce el acto sexual. \u2022 Representa la pasión sexual que sienten. \u2022 Un grupo de hombres jóvenes en el pueblo fascina a las hermanas; su romance es algo picante: piden rosas del pueblo, lo cual representa aquí chicas. \u000aDiscurso feminista: Adela se rebela y dice que hará cualquier cosa para estar con Pepe. Bernarda sigue su papel de autoridad, pero el público empieza a darse cuenta que algo muy grande se está urdiendo que quizá ella no pueda controlar como quiere. Pecado de Librada: Bernarda y Martirio concuerdan con los que la quieren matar, pero a Adela le da lástima y quiere que le den la libertad. \u2022 Forma parte del trasfondo de la obra: el de un pueblo tradicionalista y restringido en asuntos sexuales. Cuando los impulsos naturales se restringen tan severamente, el resultado son actos salvajes y horripilantes como este. \u000aIronía de la ignorancia de Bernarda: Poncia dice que Bernarda es capaz de saber lo que está pasando a muchas leguas de su casa, pero no sabe lo que pasa en su propia casa. Esta ceguera es un ejemplo de ironía dramática y de ciertas faltas de Bernarda (hamartia de la tragedia griega) y de arrogancia (el hubris). \u000aLas relaciones sociales e interpersonales: Si bien uno asume que debe haber los lazos de amor entre los miembros de la familia, lo que vemos es sobre todo hostilidades reprimidas y odio entre las hermanas. ¿Cuáles son las causas de esta ruptura de los vínculos tradicionales ? En parte , es la comunidad en la que viven , con sus reglas y tradiciones restrictivas , junto con el poder represivo de la madre dominante . Como resultado, el juego ilustra brillantemente cómo los factores externos operan dentro de las relaciones humanas. \u000aPersonajes: Amelia es muy inocente y amable; Martirio es una mujer angustiada y negativa que amarga los pensamientos de Amelia. Relación más conflictiva: Magdalena llama a Martirio una hipócrita. Bernarda y sus hijas: Parece que le tienen miedo; no hay respeto ni amor. \u000aBernarda Alba: la antagonista, con su reprensible sentido del poder, así como su concepto reaccionario de la honra, destruye las vidas de sus hijas. \u000aActo III: \u000aEspíritu de paz y sosiego (calm): Propósito dramático es un tipo de alivio\u000aSimbolismo: \u000aCaballo sin desbravar dando patadas en el corral: Simboliza la fuerza masculina encerrada y apartada de las mujeres; sus patadas son un recuerdo constante para las hermanas de esa pasión que se les prohíbe. \u000aLa oveja que trae la abuela: el instinto maternal; sed de contacto con hombres, del placer carnal; \u000aDestrucción del bastón de Bernarda: destruye su autoridad. \u000aMuerte de Adela: ¿ culpabilidad de Martirio? Sí, se puede llegar a esa conclusión. Martirio ama a Pepe y ya le había dicho a Adela que haría cualquier cosa por prohibir que Adela salga la victoriosa con Pepe. \u000aLa palabra SILENCIO: Empieza con "silencio". Termina con "silencio". Puede significar una estructura circular: nada cambiará en la casa y seguirá la tristeza y la frustración. \u000aSubversión del arquetipo del hombre controlador: La mujer (Bernarda) es la que controla. Lleva un bastón, el cual es un símbolo fálico.

sVSoneto XXIII/ En tanto que de rosa y azucena; Garcilaso de la Vega
p47605
VGénero: Poesía del Siglo de Oro - Soneto renacentista (lírica)\u000aSiglo: XVI\u000aMovimiento: Renacimiento\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGarcilaso's "En tanto que de rosa y azucena" is a "classical" Renaissance sonnet with a carpe diem theme. It contains all of the characteristics of the Latin theme: extolling the beauty of the woman, an erotic subtext, and the warning to seize the day, as time will rob her of her beauty and seductiveness. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aMetaphor vs. metonymy: This might be a good place to emphasize once again the difference between metaphor and metonymy. In a metaphor, there is an explicit sign with which to compare. For instance, in "En tanto que de rosa y azucena / se muestra la color de vuestro gesto" there is an explicit referent to the woman's face ("vuestro gesto"). One can safely assume that we are dealing with chromatic symbolism: the red of the rose and the white of the lily refer to the coloration of the woman's complexion. However, in metonymy there is no specific reference point, so the reader must figure it out on his or her own. This occurs in the Garcilaso poem with "antes que el tiempo airado / cubra de nieve la hermosa cumbre." Here we have to infer that the "tiempo airado" refers to the cold blasts of winter, the "hermosa cumbre" is the woman's head, and the "nieve" refers to gray hairs (before winter dumps its snow on the mountain = a woman with gray hair). The metonymy is much more difficult than metaphor, and it is used more frequently in Spanish poetry than in English, where it is often referred to as a \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE. \u000aOposición de colores: Cálido (rosa, ardiente, encender, oro, alegre primavera, dulce fruto, etc.); blancura (azucena, nieve, tiempo airado, viento helado, etc.). \u000aMetonimia: Tiempo airado, nevada. \u2022 Los colores cálidos representan la primavera y los blancos el invierno. "Tiempo airado"- clima "enojado", o sea "mal tiempo". \u000aTiempo: El tiempo que pasa rápidamente. \u2022 Son iguales. \u2022 El tiempo pasa rápidamente. La primavera se convierte en invierno (la juventud pasa a la vejez). El tiempo cambia todo. La rosa del primer verso se marchita en la última estrofa.

La ira del padre se debe en parte a que la hija infringe esa ley sagrada. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes:\u000aPluralismo étnico/racial: El medio ambiente gallego recalca las diferencias étnicas en España. \u000aSigno polisémico: medias rojas: Para Ildara representan su libertad, pero el padre no aprecia esa independencia. Le niega la libertad. Él ve las medias rojas como símbolo de vanidad. \u2022 Normalmente, los hombres emigraban primero y luego traían a su familia. Ildara va sola. No tiene quien la reciba cuando llegue. Es muy probable que tenga que prostituirse. Ese podría ser el simbolismo oculto de las medias rojas. \u000aGénero: machismo/feminismo: \u000a*Ildara sueña con la búsqueda de una nueva vida y apartarse a sí misma de la brutalidad de su padre de Ildar pero sus sueños se ven frustrados . Las mujeres , en consecuencia , están siendo dominados por los hombres. \u000a*Otro ejemplo de la continuidad de la tradición de la mujer oprimida y dominada por el hombre se ve donde un padre, por sus acciones violentas, impide que su hija busque una mejor vida independiente como mujer.\u000a*El tío Clodio de "Las medias rojas" hace lo necesario por impedir la emigración de su hija al Nuevo Mundo, lo cual condena a Ildara a una vida de opresión y miseria\u000aCostumbrismo: los elementos costumbristas crean un ambiente denso. Ildara recoge la madera , hace una fogata, cocina un caldo gallego , el padre saca un cigarrillo y fuma, etc. Los códigos indican el estatus social de la familia : el " señor amo , " la tierra que el padre trabaja duro, pero de la cual no es el dueño, la necesidad de emigrar de una vida mejor , etc.\u000aCromatismo: el color rojo: La uña de ámbar del padre; el cigarrillo encendido; la lumbre del fuego; las medias rojas. \u000aDescripción poética-acto de violencia: La descripción "puntos brillantes . . . radiación de intensos coloridos sobre un negro terciopeloso" produce un contraste brusco. Suaviza en algo para el lector el acto horripilante. \u000aSigno: "sus ojos alumbrados"- hoguera: La hoguera alumbra con su lumbre; el dolor la causa ver un cielo estrellado. Los signos se transforman: el dolor también 'alumbra' sus ojos, pero con otro sentido que la palabra previa, que se refería a su alegría por un nuevo porvenir.\u000aDestinatario: reacciona ante los hechos solamente / Narrador: no interpreta, solo cuenta. Es completamente objetivo. Aunque parece que siente lástima por Ildara, a la misma vez se vislumbra una crítica cultural por abandonar al padre.

p48007
VGénero: Teatro del absurdo\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardismo\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aLos países latinoamericanos han sufrido múltiples crisis económicas en el siglo XX. En Argentina, que tiene una población bien educada, ha sufrido también del desempleo, o sea para conseguir trabajo mucha gente tiene que tomar puestos muy inferiores a lo que merece su formación académica. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aLas divisiones socioeconómicas: Los efectos deshumanizantes de perder el trabajo debido a las condiciones económicas severas es impulsado en esta obra en un acto\u000aLos actores como narradores, cosa rara en una pieza de teatro. El teatro no tiene una voz que le explique las circunstancias al público. Los mismos personajes tienen que dar a conocer la circunstancia directamente, sin intervención alguna. La narrativa tiene la ventaja de tener un narrador que puede, si quiere, dar explicaciones. \u000aSituación económica: El protagonista está desempleado por mucho tiempo y está desesperado. Encuentra trabajo como el de un perro de guardia. \u2022 El gerente le promete que cuando haya una vacante lo colocarán pero siempre hay una razón por no colocarlo y siempre tiene que ver con el esfuerzo de las grandes empresas a producir más con menos gente. \u000aPara sobrevivir el esposo le sugiere a la esposa mudarse a un apartamento con varias otras mujeres; él le traerá la carne que le dan de comida, porque se ha acostumbrado a comerse solo el hueso.\u000aHumor: Hay muchos pero cuando el Actor 1 va a besar a su mujer y en vez la muerde. Es un tipo de humor negro, porque provoca risa ante una situación de aflicción. \u000aCompasión humana: Hay mucha compasión humana.

p49203
VThe contemporary fallacy of arbitrarily terminating any discussion of one's own standpoints or behavior, no matter how absurd, dangerous, evil or offensive, by drawing a phony curtain of privacy around oneself and one's actions. A corrupt argument from ethos (your own). (E.g., "Sure, I was doing eighty and weaving between lanes on Mesa Street--what's it to you? You're not a cop, you're not my nanny. It's my business to speed, and your business to get the hell out of my way. Mind your own business!" Or, "Yeah, I killed my baby. So what? Butt out! It's none of your business!") Rational discussion is cut off because "it is none of your business!" See also, "Taboo." The counterpart of this is "Nobody Will Ever Know," (also "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas;" "I Think We're Alone Now," or the Heart of Darkness Syndrome) the fallacy that just because nobody important is looking (or because one is on vacation, or away in college, or overseas) one may freely commit immoral, selfish, negative or evil acts at will without expecting any of the normal consequences or punishment . Author Joseph Conrad graphically describes this sort of moral degradation in the character of Kurtz in his classic novel, The Heart of Darkness.

sVPrendimiento de Antonito el Camborio en el camino de Sevilla; Federico Garcia Lorca
p49791
VGénero: Poesía (Romance)\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Vanguardismo español \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aAquí vemos otro grupo marginado en la sociedad española : los gitanos. Muchas de las imágenes icónicas de España, como la del flamenco, tienen raíces gitanas, y los españoles admiran folclore gitano ; sin embargo, detestan la raza gitana por su falta de voluntad para asimilarse . Otro punto es estereotipos. Antoñito no es un gitano típico, pero sufre las mismas consecuencias como si él fuera. Para hacer el tema aún más complejo, la policía lo critica por no ser como los demás gitanos, que hubiera sacado sus cuchillos y se hubiera defendido. Es un caso de " maldito si lo haces, condenado si no lo haces.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aForma métrica: Es un romance; versos de 8 sílabas; asonancia en o/o en versos pares. \u000aCarácter dramático: No se dan detalles. ¿Por qué prenden a Antonio? ¿Por qué sospechan que no es gitano legítimo? El oidor tiene que intuir. Hay diálogo, lo cual contribuye a su aspecto dramático.\u000aImagenes hípicas (equestrian): La vara puede ser para espolear al caballo. \u2022 El ritmo de los primeros versos; la vara de mimbre puede ser para espolear al caballo; la brisa es "ecuestre".\u000aLa vara de mimbre: puede representar su hombría. Nota que cuando lo llevan preso no lleva su vara. \u000aSignos implícitos: Limones/Vara de mimbre- Los gitanos tienen mala fama de ladrones, pero Antoñito solo toma limones. Estos signos son muchos elementos de vanguardia no como un romance tradicional. \u000aPerífrasis: "Lo llevó codo a codo"- efecto de fuerza\u000aSinécdoque: "Los cinco tricornios"- Sombrero de tres picos- Miembros de la Guardia Civil Española\u000aMetonimia: "brisa, ecuestre/salta los montes de plomo" \u2192 atardecer con una suave brisa -a la que el poeta atribuye un audaz calificativo: ecuestre-, que cabalga soplando sobre los montes que presentan un color gris azulado: "y una corta brisa, ecuestre, / salta los montes de plomo" <versos 23-24>. Al llamar ecuestre a la brisa se la compara con un caballo. \u000aTiempo y ambiente: El ritmo lento, con comas, de la tercera estrofa. Además, usa el adverbio "despacio". Las aceitunas "aguardan" la noche.Signos de ambiente andaluz: Gitano, Sevilla, aceitunas y olivares ("montes de plomo"), imágenes de la corrida de toros, los guardias civiles, etc\u000aUso del diminutivo: Antoñito- lo hace parecer más simpático y menos ofensivo. Es el diminutivo que se emplea para los chicos de la familia.

It, like the predicate adjective, follows a linking verb and is located in the predicate of the sentence. Example: Julia Roberts is a movie star. movie star = predicate nominative, as it renames the subject, Julia Roberts (2) the predicate adjective -- an adjective, a group of adjectives, or adjective clause that follows a linking verb. It is in the predicate of the sentence, and modifies, or describes, the subject. Example: Warren remained optimistic. optimistic = predicate adjective, as it modifies the subject, Warren

p49881
VThe sensory details or figurative language used to describe, arouse emotion, or represent abstractions. ON a physical level, imaginary uses terms related to the five senses; we refer to visual auditory, tactile, gustatory, or olfactory imaginary. On a broader and deeper level, however, one image can represent more than one thing. For example, a rose may present visual imagery while also representing the color in a woman's cheeks and/or symbolizing some degree of perfection (It is the highest flower on the Great Chain of Being). An author may use complex imagery while simultaneously employing other figures of speech, especially metaphor and simile. In addition, this term can apply to the total of all the images in a work. On The AP Exam, pay attention to how an author creates imagery and to the effect of this imagery.

VIn literature, the perspective from which a story is told. There are two general divisions of point of view, and many subdivisions within those. (1) The first person narrator tells the story with the first person pronoun, "I," and is a character in the story. This narrator can be the protagonist, a participant (character in a secondary role), or an observer (a character who merely watches the action). 2) The third person narrator relates the events with the third person pronouns, "he," "she," and "it." There are two main subdivisions to be aware of: omniscient and limited omniscient. In the "third person omniscient" point of view, the narrator, with godlike knowledge, presents the thoughts and actions of any or all characters. This all-knowing narrator can reveal what each character feels and thinks at any given moment. The "third person limited omniscient" point of view, as its name implies, presents the feelings and thoughts of only one character, presenting only the actions of all remaining characters.

p51331
VGénero: Prosa - Cuento fantástico\u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Boom latinoamericano \u000aContexto histórico: \u000aEl abrazaba la de igualdad social \u2014los ideales de la Revolución Mexicana, pero Filiberto pertenecía a la burguesía de sangre europea. Aunque era muy aficionado a colectar piezas prehispánicas. \u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000a*Carlos Fuentes, enfrenta al mundo europeo de Filiberto contra el mundo prehispánicas de Chac Mool. Mientras Filiberto admira las culturas prehispánicas , él no está preparado para aceptar la supremacía sobre sus tradiciones occidentales. Visto de esta manera , el cuento magistral se ajusta a las categorías de la asimilación , la diversidad , y el nacionalismo. \u000aTiempo: La mayor parte de la narrativa es en "flashback", mientras el narrador lee y trata de interpretar el diario de Filiberto. Pero la historia en sí tiene un movimiento circular; que comienza con la muerte de Filiberto y termina con su féretro siendo llevado a su casa en la Ciudad de México .\u000aDualidad del ser: Por un lado , Chac Mool es una extensión de su ser -el lado mexicano de Filiberto . Por otro lado, sin embargo, él se escapa su herencia mexicana cuando la parte indígena de su psique toma el control de él . En consecuencia , se retira a su lado Europea ( el hotel Alemán en la cosmopolita Acapulco) .\u000aCreación literaria: presenta un juego muy desafiante con el punto de la narrativa. Todo el lector y el narrador saben es lo que leemos en el diario de Filiberto . Este tipo de escritura es muy único, ya que no está destinado a ser entendido por otros . Sus destinatario previsto es el emisor del mensaje. En consecuencia , no entendemos\u000aexactamente lo que estaba pasando en la vida de Filiberto que lo llevara a su muerte . Lo qué sí sabemos es parecía estar alucinando , pensando que la estatua de Chac Mool se estaba transformando en un ser vivo y tratando de dominar a Filiberto. El narrador, como el lector, entiende que esto es puramente fantástica ; sin embargo, cuando el narrador devuelve el cuerpo a casa de Filiberto, es recibido por Chac Mool . El significado es muy Cervantino . ¿Dónde termina la realidad y comienza lo fantástico ? ¿Qué es cierto y qué no es?\u000a**Las dificultades narratológicas que Fuentes demanda la atención constante de su lector \u000aRealidad y fantasía: no puede distinguir fácilmente entre uno y el otro. ¿Es Chac Mool verdadero o fantástico? Las ideas de Filiberto son muy confusas. Son una jerigonza (gibberish) desordenada.\u000aNo hay una realidad fija. Lo que parece fantástico a uno puede ser verdad o normal para otro. El lector ha creído que Chac Mool era una fantasía de Filiberto, pero ahora descubre que no. Es un juego ontológico y existencial.\u000aFinal: Chac Mool está todo pintado, tratando de imitar a un mexicano blanco. \u2022 Chac Mool parece ridículo; no lleva a cabo su imitación de burgués europeo \u2022 Intento simbólico: Cuando el indígena llega a un estado de poder, solo imita la cultura de los europeos.

VThe contemporary fallacy of a person in power falsely describing an imposed punishment or penalty as a "consequence" of another's negative act. E.g.," The consequences of your misbehavior could include suspension or expulsion." A corrupt argument from ethos, arrogating to oneself or to one's rules or laws an ethos of cosmic inevitability, i.e., the ethos of God, Fate, Destiny or Reality Itself. Freezing to death is a "consequence" of going out naked in subzero weather but going to prison is a punishment for bank robbery, not a natural, inevitable or unavoidable "consequence," of robbing a bank. Not to be confused with the Argument from Consequences, which is quite different. An opposite fallacy is that of Moral Licensing.

A frequently cited example proceeds as follows; Major premise: All men are mortal Minor premise: Socrates is a man. Conclusion: Therefore, Socrates is mortal. A Syllogism's conclusion is valid only if each of the two premises is valid. Syllogisms may also present the specific idea first ("Socrates") and the general second ("All men"). Ex. All men are mortal. Socrates is a man. Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

sVRhetorical modes -
p52053
VThis flexible term describes the variety, the conventions, and purposes of the major kinds of writing. The four most common rhetorical modes and their purposes are as follows: (1) The purpose of exposition (or expository writing) is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. The AP language exam essay questions are frequently expository topics. (2) The purpose of argumentation is to prove the validity of an idea, or point of view, by presenting sound reasoning, discussion, and argument that thoroughly convince the reader. Persuasive writing is a type of argumentation having an additional aim of urging some form of action. (3) The purpose of description is to re-create, invent, or visually present a person, place, event or action so that the reader can picture that being described. Sometimes an author engages all five senses in description; good descriptive writing can be sensuous and picturesque. Descriptive writing may be straightforward and objective or highly emotional and subjective. (4) The purpose of narration is to tell a story or narrate an event or series of events. This writing mode frequently uses the tools of descriptive writing. These four modes are sometimes referred to as mode of discourse.

p52597
VHow a speaker or author constructs a sentence affects what the audience understands. The inverted order of an interrogative sentence cues the reader or listener to a question and creates a tension between speaker and listener. Similarly short sentences are often emphatic, passionate or flippant, whereas longer sentences suggest the writer's thoughtful response.

sVHeroes All
p52809
VThe contemporary fallacy that everyone is above average or extraordinary. A corrupted argument from pathos (not wanting anyone to lose or to feel bad). Thus, every member of the Armed Services, past or present, who served honorably is a national hero, every student who competes in the Science Fair wins a ribbon or trophy, and every racer is awarded a winner's yellow jersey. This corruption of the argument from pathos, much ridiculed by American humorist Garrison Keeler, ignores the fact that if everybody wins nobody wins, and if everyone's a hero no one's a hero. The logical result of this fallacy is that, as children's author Alice Childress (1973) writes, "a hero ain't nothing but a sandwich." See also the "Soldiers' Honor Fallacy."

sVSoneto CLXVI/ Mientras por competir con tu cabello; Luis de regote Gongora
p53383
VGénero: Lírica - Soneto\u000aSiglo: XVII\u000aMovimiento: Siglo de Oro- Barroco \u2192 Culteranismo \u000aContexto histórico:\u000aMovimiento cultural español (1580-1700) caracterizado por su complejidad y su extravagante ornamentación, cuyo propósito era asombrar e incitar introspección. Góngora's poem "Mientras por competir con tu cabello" conforms to the same pattern but is a product of the Baroque. The emphasis in Góngora is much more in death than just growing old. He combines the theme of memento mori, with its dark, cynical undercurrent. It also includes much more culteranismo, making the sonnet more convoluted owing to its Baroque heritage. These two poems form a nice contrast for comparing the Renaissance to the Baroque.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTema: Carpe Diem (disfrutar la vida porque llega la muerte) \u000aForma métrica: \u2022 Catorce versos endecasílabos divididos en 2 cuartetos y 2 tercetos con rima consonante en ABBA/ABBA/CDE/DCE.\u000aHiberbatos (2nd cuarteto): Mientras más ojos siguen tus labios para cogerlos que los que siguen al clavel temprano. \u2022 Los hombres miran tus labios más que al clavel temprano (metonimia para "capullo del clavel", o sea, clavel sin brotar, joven, virgen) para cogerlos (gozar de ellos en su sentido erótico).\u000aMetonimia: Naturaleza- Cabello/oro, frente/lilio, labios/clavel, cuello/luciente cristal\u000aSinécdoque: Edad dorada = La juventud. (1er terceto)\u000a2ndo terceto: Colores \u2192 Plata, violeta débil \u2192 se asocia con la muerte (la tez después de muerto). \u000aSubtexto - Verbos 'coger' y 'gozar' Tienen sentido erótico, como se vio en el soneto de Garcilaso. \u2022 La virginidad de la mujer (flor sin brotar o abrirse). \u000aAnáfora: No se emplea la misma palabra en versos consecutivos, sino a principios de una nueva idea.\u000aAliteración: Crean efectos fónicos y musicales\u2192 Los sonidos bilabiales ('m', 'p' y 'b') en el primer verso: "Mientras por competir con tu cabello"\u000aNo se emplea la misma palabra en versos consecutivos, sino a principios de una nueva idea.\u000a Asyndeton: where the prepositions or articles are purposely omitted. An example can also be found in the Góngora poem where he writes "goza cuello, cabello, labio y frente" in stead of "goza del cuello, del cabello, del labio y de la frente," especially as the final noun is feminine while the others are masculine.

p53469
VThe Cold War-era fantasy that an enemy can instantly win over an unsuspecting audience with their vile but somehow unspeakably persuasive "propaganda," e.g., "Don't look at that website! They're trying to brainwash you with their propaganda!" Historically, "brainwashing" refers more properly to the inhuman Argumentum ad Baculum of "beating an argument into" a prisoner via pain, fear, sensory or sleep deprivation, prolonged abuse and sophisticated psychological manipulation (also, the "Stockholm Syndrome."). Such "brainwashing" can also be accomplished by pleasure ("Love Bombing,"), e.g., "Did you like that? I know you did. Well, there's lots more where that came from when you sign on with us!" (See also, "Bribery.") An unspeakably sinister form of persuasion by brainwashing involves deliberately addicting a person to drugs and then providing or withholding the substance depending on the addict's compliance. Note: Only the "other side" brainwashes. "We" never brainwash.

sVThe Big Lie Technique
p53489
VThe contemporary fallacy of repeating a lie, fallacy, slogan, talking-point, nonsense-statement or deceptive half-truth over and over in different forms (particularly in the media) until it becomes part of daily discourse and people believe it without further proof or evidence. E.g., "What about the Jewish Question?" Note that when this particular phony debate was going on there was no "Jewish Question," only a "Nazi Question," but hardly anybody in power recognized or wanted to talk about that. Writer Miles J Brewer expertly demolishes The Big Lie Technique in his (1930) short story, "The Gostak and the Doshes." However, more contemporary examples of the Big Lie fallacy might be the completely fictitious August 4, 1964 "Tonkin Gulf Incident" concocted under Lyndon Johnson as a justification for escalating the Vietnam War, or the non-existent "Weapons of Mass Destruction" (conveniently abbreviated "WMD's" in order to lend this Big Lie a legitimizing, military-sounding ethos) in Iraq, used in 2003 as a false justification for invading that country.

sVAppeal to Force (Argumentum Ad Baculum or the "Might-Makes-Right" Fallacy):
p53865
VThis argument uses force, the threat of force, or some other unpleasant backlash to make the audience accept a conclusion. It commonly appears as a last resort when evidence or rational arguments fail to convince a reader. If the debate is about whether or not 2+2=4, an opponent's argument that he will smash your nose in if you don't agree with his claim doesn't change the truth of an issue. Logically, this consideration has nothing to do with the points under consideration. The fallacy is not limited to threats of violence, however. The fallacy includes threats of any unpleasant backlash--financial, professional, and so on. Example: "Superintendent, you should cut the school budget by $16,000. I need not remind you that past school boards have fired superintendents who cannot keep down costs." While intimidation may force the superintendent to conform, it does not convince him that the choice to cut the budget was the most beneficial for the school or community. Lobbyists use this method when they remind legislators that they represent so many thousand votes in the legislators' constituencies and threaten to throw the politician out of office if he doesn't vote the way they want. Teachers use this method if they state that students should hold the same political or philosophical position as the teachers or risk failing the class. Note that it is isn't a logical fallacy, however, to assert that students must fulfill certain requirements in the course or risk failing the class!

sVThey're Not Like Us
p53901
VA badly corrupted, discriminatory argument from ethos where facts, arguments, experiences or objections are arbitrarily disregarded, ignored or put down without serious consideration because those involved "are not like us," or "don't think like us." E.g., "It's OK for Mexicans to earn a buck an hour in the maquiladoras. If it happened here I'd call it brutal exploitation and daylight robbery but south of the border, down Mexico way they're not like us." Or, "You claim that life must be really terrible over there for terrorists to ever think of blowing themselves up with suicide vests just to make a point, but always remember that they're different from us. They don't think about life and death the same way we do." A vicious variety of the Ad Hominem Fallacy, most often applied to non-white or non-Christian populations. A variation of this fallacy is the "Speakee" Fallacy ("You speakee da English?"), in which an opponent's arguments are mocked, ridiculed or dismissed solely because of the speaker's alleged or real accent, dialect, or lack of fluency in standard English, e.g., "He told me 'Vee vorkers need to form a younion!' but I told him to come back when he learns to speak proper English." An extreme example of "They're Not Like Us" is Dehumanization, where opponents are dismissed as mere cockroaches, lice, apes, monkeys, rats, weasels or bloodsucking parasites who have no right to speak at all and probably should be "squashed like bugs." This fallacy is the "logic" behind genocide and gas ovens. See also "Name Calling" and "Olfactory Rhetoric." The opposite of this fallacy is the "Pollyanna Principle" above.

American society is so much different from that in Europe, with a closer gap between the rich and poor. They are part of the "most perfect society now existing in the world." New everything has re-energized people who had no place in Europe. The laws protect the new immigrant and lands allow them to be free-land holding individuals. In America, the government is derived directly from the people. An American is either "an European or the descendant of an European." Crevecoeur was the first to describe America as the a melting pot of cultures and ideas. \u000a\u000aWrote under pen name of J.

sVThe Argument from Ignorance
p54007
VThe fallacy that since we don't know (or can never know, or cannot prove) whether a claim is true or false, it must be false (or that it must be true). E.g., "Scientists are never going to be able to positively prove their theory that humans evolved from other creatures, because we weren't there to see it! So, that proves the Genesis six-day creation account is literally true as written!" This fallacy includes Attacking the Evidence, e.g. "Some of your key evidence is missing, incomplete, or even faked! That proves I'm right!" This usually includes "Either-Or Reasoning:" E.g., "The vet can't find any reasonable explanation for why my dog died. See! See! That proves that you poisoned him! There's no other logical explanation!" A corrupted argument from logos. A fallacy commonly found in American political, judicial and forensic reasoning.

p54499
VGénero: Narrativa \u000aSiglo: XX\u000aMovimiento: Generación del 98 \u000a\u000a\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aGrupo de novelistas, poetas, ensayistas y filósofos españoles, activos durante y después de la Guerra de Cuba (1898), que restauraron a España a una prominencia intelectual y literaria. Les era de gran importancia definir a España como una entidad cultural e histórica.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aEl enigma de la existencia: San Manuel lucha con su conciencia interior de la existencia de Dios. Él se ocupa de su dilema mediante la presentación de dos personajes por separado : el exterior , obediente, sin embargo, sacerdote poco ortodoxo y , el atormentado hombre interior . La imagen , sin embargo, no es de un hombre hipócrita , pero más bien la de un ser espiritual que siente que no debería molestar a sus feligreses con su\u000aangustia personal . En cambio, se construye una realidad ideal en el que sus sujetos llevan una existencia feliz en su ignorancia. \u000aCreación literaria: Hay dos narradores: Angela, que narra lo recuerda de la vida de Manuel (ella escribe en la vejez de sus recuerdos de juventud ), y el autor explícito, Unamuno, interviene al final y\u000aHace comentarios sobre la novela ( un claro ejemplo de la narración autoconsciente). Pero aún más\u000aintrigante es el hecho de que el narrador, Angela, afirma que el arzobispo está investigando y recopilando testimonios para la canonización de Manuel . ¿Qué pasará cuando el manuscrito de Angela llegue al alcance del arzobispo ? Claramente, su testimonio arruinará la investigación y negará la santidad de don Manuel . Esto pone en tela de juicio el objetivo del narrador. \u000aConversión de agua del lago a vino: Para mantenerlo embriagado para estar feliz. \u2022 Con el opio, la gente está en un estado ebrio sin pensar en cosas contundentes. Marx lo decía como crítica de la iglesia, cuya intención, según él, era mantener a la gente ignorante y controlada. Manuel quiere mantener al pueblo ignorante, porque eso conduciría a la felicidad.\u000aLeitmotiv: montaña, lago, leyenda del pueblo sumergido en el lago- es leitmotiv porque se repite muchas veces a lo largo de la novela y sirve como un elemento estructurante. Puede significar muchas cosas: la montaña va hacia el cielo, el lago hacia abajo (el infierno), etc. \u000aCita importante: Angela dice que don Manuel y Lázaro murieron "creyendo no creer...pero sin creer creerlo" Hay aliteración en "cre", la cual crea efectos sonoros; las repeticiones de las mismas palabras es semejante a la epífora en la poesía. La ironía es que terminaron creyendo sin creer \u2014una clara paradoja.\u000aMarco temporal: No tiene marco temporal porque no hay referencias históricas. Propósito: No es una narración realista o social; es una novela de ideas. El autor implica que son asuntos eternos, no ligados a un momento histórico.

sVIntransitive verb
p55089
VA *blank* verb does not take a direct object. 1. Often, nothing follows *blank* verbs. Example: "This hurts." 2. At other times, an adverb (or adverb phrase) will follow an intransitive verb. Examples: "She went too far." "He ran around the block." In these examples, "too far" is an adverb phrase, and "around the block", a prepositional phrase, is functioning as an adverb. 3. Quite often, a special kind of intransitive verb called a linking verb is followed by a subject complement, which is either a predicate adjective or a predicate nominative. Subject complements rename or describe the subject and function therefore as adjectives. Examples: "You are a student." "She seems nice." In these examples, the noun phrase "a student" renames the subject "you" and the adjective "nice" describes the subject "she". Note that the linking verb does not convey any kind of action but instead "links", or connects" the subject with its subject complement.

She would be sorry someday\u2014maybe when it was too late. Ah, if he could only die TEMPORARILY!" (Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain)\u000aTom arouses feelings of pity in readers' minds by telling how the girl, whom he loved, treated him like an animal despite his honest feelings for her.

sVNon-recognition
p58313
VA deluded fallacy in which one deliberately chooses not to publicly "recognize" ground truth, usually on the theory that this would somehow reward evil-doers if we recognize their deeds as real. Often the underlying theory is that the situation is "temporary" and will soon be reversed. E.g., In the decades from 1949 until Richard Nixon's presidency the United States officially refused to recognize the existence of the most populous nation on earth, the People's Republic of China because America supported the Republic of China government on Taiwan instead and hoped they might return to power on the mainland. More than half a century after the Korean War the U.S. still refuses to pronounce the name of or recognize a nuclear-armed DPRK (North Korea). An individual who does this risks institutionalization (e.g., "I refuse to recognize Mom's murder, 'cuz that would give the victory to the murderer! I refuse to watch you bury her! Stop! Stop!") but tragically, such behavior is only too common in international relations. See also the State Actor Fallacy, Political Correctness, and The Pout.

sVThe Soldiers' Honor Fallacy
p58377
VThe ancient fallacy that all who wore a uniform, fought hard and followed orders are worthy of some special honor or glory or are even "heroes," whether they fought for freedom or fought to defend slavery, marched under Grant or Lee, Hitler, Stalin or McArthur, fought to defend their homes, fought for oil or to spread empire, or even fought against and killed U.S. soldiers!. A corrupt argument from ethos (that of a soldier), closely related to the "Finish the Job" fallacy ("Sure, he died for a lie, but he deserves honor because he followed orders and did his job to the end!"). See also "Heroes All." This fallacy was recognized and decisively refuted at the Nuremburg Trials after World War II but remains powerful to this day nonetheless. See also "Blind Loyalty." Related is the State Actor Fallacy, that those who fight and die for a country (America, Russia, Iran, the Third Reich, etc.) are worthy of honor or at least pardonable while those who fight for a non-state actor (abolitionists, guerrillas, freedom-fighters, jihadis) are not and remain "terrorists" no matter how noble or vile their cause, until or unless they are adopted by a state after the fact.

sVEmotional Appeals (pathos)
p58379
VEmotional appeals reach the reader by activating the reader's emotions. Often writers make emotional appeals by including sensory details, especially imagery. Calling upon the reader's pleasant memories, nostalgia, anger, or fear are frequent emotional appeals found in argumentative texts. The presence of "charged words" (references to religious doctrine or patriotic ideas) in an argumentative text represents an attempt at an emotional appeal by the writer.

sVComo La Vida Misma; Rosa Montero
p58479
VGénero: Prosa contemporánea española\u000aSiglo: XXI\u000aMovimiento: Feminismo\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aTiempo y espacio: Rosa Montero crea un espacio denso en un lapso muy corto de tiempo. Ella describe un atasco de tráfico y el estado psicológico del narrador de la mente en el más mínimo detalle . El lector entra en el espacio de la narración , porque todos hemos tenido una experiencia similar y tenía reacciones similares .\u000aNarración: En el presente, a veces en primera persona, pero principalmente se desdobla y habla de sí mismo en forma de tú. ¿Qué es el efecto de narrar de este modo? El presente da un sentido de inmediatez. La forma de tú hace sentir al lector como parte de la experiencia. \u2022 También te hace sentir presente en lo que está ocurriendo. Casi todo el mundo ha tenido las mismas experiencias.\u000aTécnica narrativa: el narrador se dirige a sí mismo, pero con la forma del tú involucra al lector también. \u2022 Los conductores se comunican entre ellos con gestos y miradas. \u2022 El dialogo emplea solamente en la forma del fluir de la conciencia. \u2022 Muchos detalles minuciosos combinados con descripciones visuales, pensamientos, opiniones, expresiones, etc., todos mezclados para producir un cuadro auténtico, muy realista.\u000aHipérbole: "Doscientos mil coches apretados junto al tuyo". Sí, es muy natural. Por ejemplo: Tardé un siglo en llegar. \u2022 causan humor. \u000aExpresiones coloquiales: Imbécil, idiota, cretino, chalao, etc. Al ser muy informal, el lector se relaja ante el lenguaje que él mismo, a lo mejor, usa en estos instantes. \u000aDes/humanización del conductor: Por poco atropella a una anciana y no le importa. \u2022 Cuando le da las gracias al señor que le permitió estacionarse. \u000aIronía: El narrador cree que los otros han sido agresivos, cuando él mismo ha sido tan agresivo como los demás.

p59597
VGénero: Prosa- Apología\u000aSiglo: XV - Edad Media\u000aMovimiento: Apología\u000aContexto histórico:\u000aEl conde Lucanor; like its models, it uses a frame story to tie the tales together. This represents but one example of the many ideas of Arab culture introduced into Europe via Spain.\u000aCaracterísticas importantes: \u000aConstrucción de género: El conde Lucanor, por medio de las diferentes interpretaciones del relato que cuenta Patronio (la necesidad de domar a las mujeres y que uno debe darse a conocer al principio de una relación), subraya la complejidad del acto comunicativo: un mismo mensaje puede ser recibido de diferentes modos por diferentes destinatarios\u000aFábula: El conde Lucanor le plantea una situación a su criado Patronio, a propósito de la cual Patronio narra la anécdota de cómo un joven moro logró dominar el mal carácter de su esposa.\u000aApología: La mujer debe llegar virgen al matrimonio\u000a- Un narrador narra la primera línea del cuento \u000aNarrador(es): El autor implícito parece concebir un discurso sobre las mujeres insoportables, y el autor explícito escribe otra moraleja. La necesidad de domar y dominar a la mujer. \u2022 Que te debes dar a conocer desde el principio. \u2022 Cada destinatario interpreta los códigos de un modo diferente. \u000aEl destinatario (narratario)de Patronio es El conde. Filtros de narración: Emisión original escuchada por Patronio emitida de nuevo por Patronio al conde, el conde escribe su interpretación. Este problema forma la base de toda la narratología moderna, y ya era preocupación de la narrativa en el siglo XIV y se verá repetido en Don Quijote: ¿quién narra la historia?; ¿qué limitaciones tiene el narrador?; cuáles son sus fuentes de comunicación; ¿se puede confiar en lo que dice?. En fin, ¿cuál es la realidad?
