p5143
VBias is defined as a tendency to favor certain members of a population. The following are the main types of bias:\u000a\u000aHousehold bias- only one member of a households responds, so large households are underrepresented. \u000a\u000aNonresponse bias- people don't respond to surveys or are too difficult to contact, thus creating a source of bias. \u000a\u000aQuota sampling bias- interviewers are at liberty to pick people (ie. a specific percentage Catholic, a specific percentage African-American, etc.). \u000a\u000aResponse bias- People may lie/be untruthful when responding, especially when they're not anonymous if their views are unsavory. \u000a\u000aSelection bias- for example a newspaper interviewed just people with cars and telephones in a presidential election and predicted a landslide victory for the wrong person due to the fact that the people owning cars and telephones were wealthy and tended to vote Republican. \u000a\u000aSize bias- For instance if you have a student pick a coin out of a bag to estimate the monetary value, throw a dart at a map, etc. This benefits large states, large coins, etc. \u000a\u000aUndercoverage bias- Inadequate representation- for instance there were phone surveys to landlines which left out people who only had cell phones. Another instance of this is convenience samples, like interviews at shopping malls which just target easy to reach people. \u000a\u000aVoluntary response bias- samples where individuals can volunteer or call in often benefit people who have strong opinons. \u000a\u000aWording bias- if leading questions are used, then they may lead to biased answers.

VIf f´(x)=0 at each point of an interval I, then there is a constant C for which f(x)=C for all x in I. Example: Since f is differentiable at every point of [X1,X2], f satisfies the hypotheses of the Mean Value Theorem. Therefore, there is a point c between X1 and X2 for which f´(c) = (f(X2) - f(X1)) / (X2 - X1). Because f´(c) = 0, it follows that f(X1) = f(X2).

Product Rule: The limit of a product of 2 functions is the product of their limits. Lim x>c (f(x) * g(x))= L *M\u000a4. Constant Multiple Rule: The limit of a constant times a function is the constant ties the limit of the function. Lim x>c (k*f(x))= k*L\u000a5. Quotient Rule: The limit of a quotient of two functions is the quotient of their limits, provided the limit of the denominator is not zero. Lim x>c f(x)/g(x)= L/M, M=/=0\u000a6. Power Rule: If R and S are integers, s =/= 0, then Lim x>c (f(x))^(R/S)= L^(R/S)\u000aExample: Assume that Lim x>b f(x)=7 and Lim x>b g(x)=3\u000a(a). Lim x>b (f(x)+g(x))= 7+3=10

We assume that c(x) is differentiable. \u000ac(x) = cost of producing x items, x > 0\u000a(c(x))/x = average cost of producing x items. If the average cost can be minimized, it will be a production level at which d/(dx ) ((c(x))/x)=0\u000a\u000a (xc'(x)-c'(x))/x^2 = 0\u000a\u000a xc'(x) - c(x) = 0 \u000a\u000a c'(x) = (c(x))/x\u000a\u000aExample:\u000a\u000aSuppose c(x) = x3 - 6x2 + 15x, where x represents thousands of units. Is there a production level that minimizes average cost? If so, what is it? \u000aSOLUTION. \u000aWe look for levels at which average cost equals marginal cost. \u000a\u000aMarginal Cost: c'(x) = 3x2 - 12x + 15\u000a\u000aAverage Cost: x^2 - 6x + 15 \u000a\u000a3x2 - 12x +15 = x^2 - 6x +15 \u000a \u000a2x^2 - 6x = 0\u000a\u000a2x(x - 3) = 0\u000a\u000ax= 0 or x = 3

VLet f be continuous on the interval (a, b). To find the open intervals on which f is increasing or decreasing, use the following steps.\u000a1. Locate the critical numbers of f in (a, b), and use these numbers to determine test intervals.\u000a2. Determine the sign of f'(x) at one test value in each of the intervals.\u000a3. Use the "Test for Increasing and Decreasing Functions" to decide whether f is increasing or decreasing on each interval.

sVHow do I estimate a limit using a numerical approach?
p13513
VTo estimate a limit using a numerical approach, you must create a table. Say we have the function (x^3 -1) / (x-1) and want to find the limit as x approaches 1. We would create a table from both sides (generally 3-4 numbers from positive and negative directions) and make the numbers get closer and closer to 1. From this method we can estimate a limit by finding the value the limit is getting closer and closer to.

The incident showed that the new government under the Constitution could react swiftly and effectively to such a problem, in contrast to the inability of the government under the Articles of Confederation to deal with Shay's Rebellion.

VThe following test applies to a continuous function f(x). At a critical point c: 1) If f' changes sign from positive to negative at c (f'>0 for x<c and f'<0 for x>c), then f has a local maximum value at c. 2) If f' changes sign from negative to positive at c (f'<0 for x<c and f'>0 for x>c), then f has a local minimum value at c. 3) If f' does not change sign at c (f' has the same sign on both sides of c), then f has no local extreme value at c. At a left endpoint a: If f'<0 (f'>0) for x>a, then f has a local maximum (minimum) value at a. At a right endpoint b: If f'<0 (f'>0) for x<b, the f has a local minimum (maximum) value at b. Example: f(x)= x^3 - 12x - 5. f'(x)= 3x^2 - 12. f(x) = 0. x=2 and x=-2. Local max at x=-2 and local min at x=2. Local max value is f(-2) = 11 and the local min value is f(2) = -21

p21813
V1. The velocity of an object tells how fast it is going and in which direction. Velocity is an instantaneous rate of change.\u000a2. The speed of an object is the absolute value of the velocity, |v(t)|. It tells how fast it is going disregarding its direction.\u000a- The speed of a particle increases (speeds up) when the velocity and acceleration have the same sign. \u000a-The speed decreases (slows down) when the velocity and acceleration have opposite signs.\u000a3. The acceleration is the instantaneous rate of change of velocity - it is the derivative of the velocity- that is, a(t)=v'(t). Negative acceleration (deceleration) means that the velocity is decreasing. The acceleration gives the rate at which the velocity is changing.

p24181
VSystematic sampling- list the population in order, start at a random point and pick every tenth, hundredth, kth person from the list. This just result in a good sample as long as the list isn't ordered in any way related to the variables under consideration. \u000a\u000aStratified sampling- the population is divided into homogeneous groups called strata, and random samples from all strata are chosen (ie. you could stratify by age, income level, race, etc.). You could also do proportional sampling by choosing the sample sizes from each strata in accordance to the proportion of the total population. \u000a\u000aCluster sampling- the population is split into heterogeneous groups called clusters, and then, you take a random sample of clusters. For instance, you could randomly pick several high school classes to survey. \u000a\u000aMultistage sampling- there are two or more steps, each of which involves any of the other sampling techniques. For instance, some organizations randomly select nationwide locations, then randomly pick neighborhoods in each of these locations, then randomly pick households in each of these neighborhoods.

If the leading coefficient in the numerator is 6 and the leading coefficient in the denominator is 3 in this case, then your limit from x to infinity for this function would equal 6/3 or 2.

sVWhat is the correlation coefficient r?
p24719
VIt describes how well the data fits a linear trend. A positive r means a positive association, a negative r means a negative association and r's with higher absolute values indicate stronger relationships. r is not affected by which variable is called x or called y, and an r of 0 doesn't necessarily indicate no relationship (it could be a strong nonlinear relationship). The formula is the sum of the product of all x and y z scores divided by the sample size-1.

VA and B are independent if P(A|B)=P(A\u2229B)/P(B) = P(A)*P(B)/P(B)=P(A). This can be used to check independence with probabilities. \u000a\u000aMutually exclusive events are NOT independent except in one very special case. This is because mutually exclusive means that P(A\u2229B)=0, and independence means that P(A\u2229B)=P(A)*P(B). Thus, the only way that both can be true is if P(A)=0 or P(B)=0.

sVHow to draw the graphs of derivatives
p27757
Vy is your slope value and x is the same for the original function, the interval at which the function exists.\u000aExample: For the parent quadratic, the slope starts out as negative, but at the vertex the slope is 0 so the x value for the vertex will by the x value for derivative. Then the slope proceeds to get more positive so the derivative will look similar to the line y=x.\u000ayou can also find the derivative and graph it when given which graph is the original

VA function y=f(x) that is continuous on a closed interval [a,b] takes on every value between f(a) and f(b). In other words, if y0 is between f(a) and f(b), then y0= f(c) for some c in [a,b]. Example: Prove that f(x) at some point on the interval [1,3] = 0. f(x)= x^3-x-1 changes from negative to positive from x=1 to x=2. Therefore at some point c between 1 and 2 there is a value of f(c)=0.

VIf you want to create a garden with the largest possible area, but only have 80 feet of fencing, you need to use optimization to solve for a maximum value. Your primary equation will be A=xy and your secondary equation will be 2x+2y=80. Set your secondary equation equal to one of the variables, either x or y, and then plug the value you've found into the primary equation. Then take the derivative of this, and set it to zero. This will give you the maximum dimensions of the garden which will maximize the area.

sVWe use a Riemann Sum to approximate the area under a curve by approximating the area with a series of rectangles.\u000a\u000aA Riemann Sum can be a left-, right-, or midpoint-rectangular approximation method. These are commonly referred to as LRAM, RRAM, or MRAM. The location (left, right or midpoint) corresponds to the top of the rectangle and the location where it intersects the given curve. The \U0001d466 coordinate of each of these locations is the height of the respective rectangle for which you need to calculate the area.\u000a\u000aTypically the width of each rectangle is a uniform amount - but this is not an absolute requirement.\u000a\u000aA Riemann Sum question sometimes asks whether the sum is an overestimate or an underestimate.

p36959
VThe velocity of an object tells how fast it is moving and in what direction. Velocity is an instantaneous rate of change. If velocity is positive, then the object is moving away from its point of origin. If velocity is negative, then the object is moving back towards its point of origin. If velocity is 0, then the object is not moving at that time. The velocity of a function is found by taking its first derivative.

p40813
VFor taking limits at +infinity\u000a1. Find dominating exponents (highest ones) and compare their coefficients. The limit to infinity will be the coefficient of the numerator over the coefficient of the denominator.\u000a2. If the highest exponent in the denominator is larger than the one in the numerator the limit to infinity will be 0.\u000a3. If the highest exponent in the numerator is larger than the highest in the denominator the limit will be infinity.\u000a4. If the function is in a square route take the square of the highest exponent and use that as the highest exponent.\u000a5. If there is a radical number (number in sq. rt.) in the numerator move it to the denominator through rationalization.\u000a\u000aLimits to -infinity\u000a1. If any of the exponents are odd then that value will be negative will rather than positive. This could effect the sign of the solution.

It is often easy to think you understand something at a high level, but you don't truly learn what it is all about until you really get your hands dirty with it.

VDefine your variables (let the sides of your figure equal x, y, etc.). Write an equation representing the quantity which you need to be maximized or minimized; this is your primary equation. Create a secondary equation that allows you to find the value of one of your variables (x or y or whatever you chose to call it), and use substitution to plug the value you've found into the primary equation. Take the derivative of what you have and then set it equal to zero. The x- or y-values you get as your answer give you your maximum or minimum - depending on what you need to solve the problem.

For example, if the particle is moving left but the acceleration is going right the particle will slow down. If the direction of the acceleration is changed to go left, the particle will speed up.

sVWhat is the meaning of... "differentiation and integration are inverse processes."
p44261
VDifferentiation and integration are inverse processes. To differentiate is to take the derivative of an equation, and to integrate is to take the antiderivative of an equation. \u000a\u000aDifferentiation is normally denoted in several ways. If they ask you to find f '(x), then they are looking for the derivative. To find f '(x) is exactly the same as writing y'. The askers will (or should) tell you what you need to find for a given problem. \u000a\u000aIntegration is always denoted by this symbol: \u000a\u000a\u222b\u000a\u000aWhich is basically an elongated S. \u000a\u000aIf the askers ask you to find slope, you use derivatives. If they ask you to find the area under a given area, you use integrals. \u000a\u000aI'll give you an example of each: \u000a\u000a1. Find the equation for the tangent line of f(x) = 3x^2 at point (3,27). \u000a\u000aFor this, you find the derivative, which is 6x, and the slope is therefore 3*6 = 18. Using y = mx + b... \u000a\u000a27 = 18*3 + b \u000a-27 = b \u000ay = 18x - 27 \u000a\u000a2. Find the volume of the solid formed by rotating y = \u221ax and x = 2 about the y-axis \u000a\u000aFor this, you use integration. It's a bit more complicated to solve, so I'll just leave it at that.

VMaximum profit (if any) occurs at a production level at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Proof. We assume that r(x) and c(x) are differentiable for all x > 0, so if p(x) = r(x) - c(x) has a maximum value, it occurs at a production level at which p'(x) = 0. Since p'(x) = r'(x) - c'(x), p'(x) 0 implies that \u000ar'(x) - c'(x) = 0 or r'(x) = c'(x)\u000a\u000aExample: \u000a\u000aSuppose that r(x) = 9x and c(x) = x^3 - 6x^2 + 15x, where x represents thousands of units. Is there a production level that maximizes profit? If so, what is it? \u000aSOLUTION\u000aNotice that r'(x) = 9 and c'(x) = 3x^2 - 12x + 15.\u000a 3x^2 - 12x + 15 = 9 Set c'(x) = r'(x). \u000a 3x^2 -12x + 6 = 0 \u000aThe two solutions of the quadratic equation are\u000a x1 = (12- \u221a72)/6 = 2 -\u221a2 \u2248 0.586 \u000a and x2 = (12+\u221a72)/6 = 2 + \u221a2 \u2248 3.414

Split Ax^2 in half and put the final numbers on the outside of the box, closest to the Ax^2 integer on either side. (Ex: 2x^2 would be X and 2X) divide one of the other interior numbers found with the original diamond method by an outer number found by dividing the Ax^2, and put the product as the second half of the equation (Ex: if the outer is 2X and the interior is 10x, divide 10 by 2. Since this equals 5, that piece of the equation is 2x+5) do this for the other two numbers. This should leave you with an equation like (2x+5)(x+2)

sVWho founded the FTC? (5.4)
p56723
VIt is called FTC because it connects the two branches of calc, differential and integral. Differential Calculus arose from the tangent problem, and integral calculus arose from a seemingly, unrelated problem, the area problem. Newton's mentor at Cambridge Isaac Barrow (1630-1677), discovered that these two problems are actually closely related. He found that integration and differentiation were inverse processes. Newton and Liebnez exploited this to create a systematic mathematical method.

If the upper and lower limits are the same then there is no work to do, the integral is zero.\u000a\u000a3. Where c is any number. So, as with limits, derivatives, and indefinite integrals we can factor out a constant.\u000a\u000a4. We can break up definite integrals across a sum or difference.\u000a\u000a5. Where c is any number. This property is more important than we might realize at first. One of the main uses of this property is to tell us how we can integrate a function over the adjacent intervals, [a,c] and [c,b]. Note however that c doesn't need to be between a and b.\u000a\u000a6. The point of this property is to notice that as long as the function and limits are the same the variable of integration that we use in the definite integral won't affect the answer.
