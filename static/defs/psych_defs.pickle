This depolarizes the axon section, causing the next axon channel to open, and then the next, like a line of falling dominoes, each tripping the next. During a resting pause, the neuron pumps the positively charged sodium ions back outside. Then it can fire again.

They must care for and house animals in a humane way.\u000a3. They must acquire animal subjects legally. Animals must be purchased from accredited companies, and if wild animals are used, they need to be trapped in a human way.\u000a4. They must design experimental procedures that employ the least amount of suffering feasible.\u000a\u000a1. Coercion - Participation must be voluntary.\u000a2. Informed consent - Participants must know that they are involved in research and give their consent. If the participants are deceived in any way about the nature of the study, the deception must not be so extreme as to invalidate the informed consent. The research the participants thought they were consenting to must be similar enough to the actual study to give the informed consent meaning. Also, researchers must be very careful about the trauma deception may cause.\u000a3. Anonymity/Confidentiality - Participants' privacy must be protected. Their identities and actions must not be revealed by the researcher. Participants have anonymity when the researchers do not collect any data that enables them to match a person's responses with his or her name. In some cases, such as interview studies, a researcher cannot promise anonymity but instead guarantees confidentiality, that the researcher will not identify that source of any of the data.\u000a4. Risk - Participants cannot be placed at significant mental or physical risk. Typically, it is considered permissible to experience temporary discomfort or stress but activities that might cause someone long-term mental or physical harm must be avoided. This clause requires interpretation by the review board.\u000a5. Debriefing procedures - Participants must be told the purpose of the study and provided with ways to contact the researchers about study results. When research involves deception, it is particularly important to conduct a thorough debriefing.

Through his observations, along with knowledge about neurological structures that control linguistic communication and interpretation, Chomsky argues that language is innately organized.

Provide the ability to see things in novel ways, to recognize patterns, and to make connections.\u000aA VENTURESOME PERSONALITY- curious, risk-taker. Have to be willing to take risks. Seeks new experiences, tolerates ambiguity and risk, and perseveres in overcoming obstacles.\u000aINTRINSIC MOTIVATION- have to want to do it for themselves; you love it. (eg. Sara Bareilles- "Love Song") Being driven more by interest, satisfaction, and challenge than by external pressures.\u000aA CREATIVE ENVIRONMENT- environment that cultivates creative thinking. It will make you more creative. Sparks, supports, and refines creative ideas.

On discovering that they had actually placed the device in a region of the hypothalamus, they realized they had stumbled upon a brain center that provides pleasurable rewards, "reward centers". When allowed to press pedals to trigger their own stimulation in these areas, rats would sometimes do so at a feverish pace-up to 7000 times per hour- until they dropped from exhaustion. Moreover, to get this stimulation, they would even cross and electrified floor that a starving rat would not cross to get food.

The "Garcia Theory" (of taste aversion) is named for him. Many scientists didn't believe Garcia because it did not follow the basic principles of classical conditioning. But Garcia proved them wrong many times with his results. An internal stimulus produced an internal response, and an external stimulus produced an external response. But, an external didn't provide an internal.

V- Michael Gazzaniga and Roger W. Sperry, the first to study split brains in humans, found that several patients who had undergone a complete calloscotomy suffered from split-brain syndrome. In patients with split-brain syndrome the right hemisphere, which controls the left hand and foot, acts independently of the left hemisphere and the person's ability to make rational decisions. This can give rise to a kind of split personality, in which the left hemisphere give orders that reflect the person's rational goals, whereas the right hemisphere issues conflicting demands that reveal hidden desires.

Most human behavior is learned through modeling. From watching others, one forms an idea of how new behaviors are performed, then later acts that way.\u000aThe component processes underlying observational learning are:\u000a1. Attention, including modeled events (distinctiveness, affective valence, complexity, prevalence, functional value) and observer characteristics (sensory capacities, arousal level, perceptual set, past reinforcement), \u000a2. Retention, including symbolic coding, cognitive organization, symbolic rehearsal, motor rehearsal),\u000a3.

Stereotypes are generalizations about the appearance, behavior, mindset or other characteristics about a particular group. Prejudice is maintained by stereotypes. An example of prejudice is hiring a male auto mechanic instead of a female mechanic thinking the male is more qualified. The common stereotype is that males work more with tools and cars more than females and are therefore more qualified. In this example it shows that the prejudice is being sustained by the stereotype. Another example is hiring a male driver instructor instead of a female instructor because you believe that the male is more qualified. The stereotype in this example is that males are better drivers than females. The prejudice is being maintained by stereotypes.

This ideas of Bacon and Locke contributed to the development of modern empiricism. \u000a\u2022 In the 1960s, the humanistic psychologists and the cognitive psychologists revived interest in the study of mental processes.\u000a\u2022 Psychology is now defined as the science of behavior and mental processes.

sVMartin Seligman: learned helplessness v. positive psychology
p36950
VMartin Seligman: an American psychologist, educator, and author of self-help books. Since the late 90's, Seligman has been an avid promoter within the scientific community for the field of positive psychology.\u000aAugust 12, 1942- Present\u000a\u000aSeligman discovered that the conditioning of dogs led to outcomes that were opposite to the predictions of B.F. Skinner's behaviorism, then a leading psychological theory.\u000aSeligman studied the theory, he learned helplessness to be a psychological condition in which a human being or an animal has learned to act or behave helplessly in a particular situation, usually after experiencing some inability to avoid an adverse situation even when it actually has the power to change its unpleasant or even harmful circumstance. He notived a similarity with severely depressed patients, and argued that clinical depression and related mental illnesses result in part from a perceived absence of control over the outcome of a situation. Seligman worked with Christopher Peterson to create what they describe as a 'positive' counterpart to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM). While the DSM focuses on what can go wrong, Character Strengths and Virtues is designed to look at what can go right.

V-Best ways are twin studies and adoption studies\u000a-Monozygotic twins ("one-egg"): identical twins.

Can be same or different gender but studies only use same gender fraternal twins to eliminate any gender variances.\u000a1) By comparing/contrasting shared chances between identical twins, fraternal twins of same gender, and two random same gender siblings, researchers can help understand how much psychology items are related to genes and environment. For example: If an identical twin develops schizophrenia, their twin has a 50% chance to also develop schizophrenia. If fraternal, about a 10% chance for other twin. If siblings, about a 4% chance for sibling. Two random people, only about 1% chance. Clearly genes play a huge role, but environmental factors also play a huge role.\u000a2) By comparing/contrasting identical twins raised in the same home with identical twins raised apart, it can help filter which things are more gene oriented and which things are more environment oriented.\u000a\u000a-Thomas Bouchard: massive longitudinal study involving #2

This method allowed them to experimentally adjust the optical and tactical stimuli associated with a simulated cliff while protecting the subjects from injury. The visual cliff was made up of a sheet of Plexiglas. Since the Plexiglas supports the weight of the child, this is a visual cliff rather than a drop off. Using the Plexiglass, Gibson and Walk examined potential perceptual differences at crawling age between human infants born preterm and human infants born at term without documented visual or motor impairments.
