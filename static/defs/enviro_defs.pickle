sVDiagram and explain the sewage treatment process. How does a wetland serve the same function? Why does the amount of sewage affect the outcome.
p175
VThe sewage treatment is broken down into three different treatments. The first step is called the primary treatment whose main job is to physically separate the large solids from the liquid. Once through primary treatment, the effluent is not yet safe to discharge so it journeys its way through secondary treatment. Secondary treatment consists of the biological degradation of the dissolved organic compounds by sending the effluent into a aeration tank or a trickle bed which helps the bacteria in the tanks decompose it. During secondary treatment, the Effluent is also usually disinfected through chlorination or UV. The final step in the sewage treatment process is the tertiary treatment which basically removes plant nutrients such as nitrates and phosphates from the secondary effluent. After the tertiary treatment, The effluent is ready to be discharged into nearby waterways. Wetlands serve the same function as a sewage treatment because the discharged wastewater can filter through the wetland as it moves through it, separating the solids and effluent. The wetland is then able to break down the dissolved organic compounds or pathogen's because of the abundance of bacteria it naturally grows. The exposure to sun, air, and aquatic plants for at least 20 days is enough to make the water safe. The amount of sewage can affect the outcome because the more sewage the treatment have to deal with the less efficient it is able to clean the water.

sVWe may have already depleted half our oil reserves
p205
V- some scientists and oil industry analysts calculate that we have already extracted half of the world's oil reserves \u2014 so far we have used up about 1.1 trillion barrels of oil, and most estimates hold that somewhat more than 1 trillion barrels remain \u000a- to estimate how long this remaining oil will last, analysts calculate the reserves-to-production ratio, or R/P ratio, by dividing the amount of total remaining reserves by the annual rate of production \u000a- a growing number of scientists and analysts insist that we will face a crisis not when the last drop of oil is pumped, but when the rate of production comes to a peak and then begins to decline \u2014 a point in time nicknamed "peak oil" \u2014 they point out that as production declines following peak oil, if demand continues to increase, then we will experience an oil shortage immediately \u000a- b/c production tends to decline once reserves are depleted halfway, most of these experts calculate that the peak oil crisis will likely begin within the next several years \u000a- to understand the bass of these concerns, we need to turn back the clock to 1956 \u2014 in that year, Shell Oil geologist M. King Hubbert calculated that U.S. oil production would peak around 1970 \u2014 his predication was ridiculed at the time, but it proved to be accurate; U.S. production peaked in that very year and has continued to fall since then \u2014 the peak in production came to be known as Hubbert's peak \u000a- predicting an exact date for peak oil and the coming decline in production is difficult \u2014 b/c of year-to-year variability in production, we will not be able to recognize that we have passed the peak of oil production until several years after it has happened \u2014 many companies and governments do not reveal their true data on oil reserves, and estimates differ as to how much oil we can extract secondarily from existing deposits \u000a- the coming divergence of demand and supply will likely have momentous economic, social, and political consequence that will profoundly affect the lives of each and every one of us \u000a- More optimistic observers argue that as oil supplies dwindle, rising prices will create powerful incentives for businesses, governments, and individuals to conserve energy and develop alternative energy sources \u2014 and that these developments will save us from major disruptions caused by coming oil peak \u000a- to achieve sustainable society, we will ned to switch to renewable energy sources \u2014 investments in energy efficiency and conservation can extend the time we have to make this transition \u2014 but, the research and development needed to construct the infrastructure for new energy economy depend on having cheap oil, and the time we will have to make this enormous transition will be quite limited

V- we generate electricity from nuclear power by controlling fission in nuclear reactors, facilities contained within nuclear power plants \u2014 but this is just one step in a longer process sometimes called the nuclear fuel cycle \u2014 this process begins when the naturally occurring element uranium is mined rom underground deposits \u000a- uranium-containing minerals are uncommon, and uranium ore is in finite supply, which is why nuclear power is generally considered a nonrenewable energy source \u000a- uranium is used for nuclear power b/c it is radioactive \u000a- radioactive isotopes, or radioisotopes, emit subatomic particles and high-energy radiation as they decay into lighter radioisotopes until they ultimately become stable isotopes\u000a- the isotope uranium-235 decays into a series of laughter isotopes, eventually forming lead-207 \u2014 each radioisotope decays at a rate determined by that isotopes half-life, the time it takes for half of the atoms to give off radiation and decay \u000a- the half-life of uranium-235 is about 700 million years \u000a- b/c uranium-238 does not emit enough neutrons to maintain a chain reaction when fissioned, we use uranium-235 for commercial nuclear power \u2014 therefore, mined uranium ore must be processed to enrich the concentration of uranium-235 to at least 3% \u000a- the enriched uranium is formed into pellets of uranium dioxide, which are incorporated into metallic tubes called fuel rods that are used in nuclear reactors \u2014 after several years in a reactor, enough uranium has decayed so that the fuel no longer generates adequate energy, and it must be replaced w/ new fuel \u000a- in some countries, the spent fuel is reprocessed to recover the remaining usable energy \u2014 this process is costly relative to the low prices of uranium on the world market in recent years, so most spent fuel is disposed of as radioactive waste

sVWhat is bioremediation when it comes to cleaning up environmental hazardous materials. How does it work?
p1195
VBioremediation involves the addition of nutrients or Microorganisms that increase the rate at which natural biodegradation occurs. Biodegradation is a process by which Microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi breakdown complex compounds into simpler products to obtain nutrients and energy. What happens is that these micro organisms convert hazardous materials like oil into foods for themselves and in the process they convert the oil into non-toxic components which are then safely taken up into the food chain and surrounding environment. Bioremediation simply helps speed up this process. Bioremediation was used in the cleanup of the Exxon Valdez spill in 1989 and was used with some success.

sVCoal varies in its qualities
p1789
V- coal caries from deposits to deposits in it water content, carbon content, and the amount of potential energy it contains \u000a- organic material that is broke down anaerobically but remains wet, near the surface, and not well compressed is called peat \u000a- as peat decomposes further, as it becomes buried more deeply under sediments, as pressure and heat increase, and as time passes, water is squeezed out of the material, and carbon compounds are packed more highly together, forming coal \u000a- Scientists classify coal into four types: lignite, sub-bituminous, bituminous, and anthracite \u000a- lignite is the least-compressed type of coal, and anthracite is the most-compressed \u000a- the more compressed, the greater is its carbon content and the greater is the energy content per unit volume \u000a- coal deposits also vary in the amount of impurities they contain, including sulfur, mercury, arsenic, and other trace metals \u000a- sulfur content depends partly on whether the coal was formed in freshwater or saltwater sediments \u000a- the impurities in coal are emitted in smoke from its combustion unless pollution control measures are in place \u000a- reducing pollution from coal is important b/c society's demand for this relatively abundant fossil fuel may rise once supplies of oil & natural gas begin to decline

Cone of Depression - When a well is pumped, the water level in the well is lowered. By lowering this water level, a gradient occurs between the water in the surrounding aquifer and the water in the well. Because water flows from high to low water levels or pressure, this gradient produces a flow from the surrounding aquifer into the well. As the water flows into the well, the water levels or pressure in the aquifer around the well decrease. The amount of this decline becomes less with distance from the well, resulting in a conical-shaped depression radiating away from the well. This, in appearance, is similar to the effect one sees when the plug is pulled from a bathtub. This conical-shaped feature is the cone of depression.\u000a\u000a10. Groundwater is not renewable!

sV10 Things To Know About Energy Production with Fossil Fuels
p3941
VPollution- Coal is the worst because of acid deposition, global warming and mercury emissions. Oil is the next worst because of possibility of spill; it also contributes to global warming. Natural Gas causes the least amount of pollution. \u000aExtraction- Coal is extracted through deep or surface mining. Oil is welled and pumped, as is natural gas. \u000aReserves- Coal- Russia, China, India, U.S.A; Oil- Persian Gulf; Natural Gas- Kazakhstan, Persian Gulf, Russia \u000aOrder of Abundance (most to least)- Coal, Oil, Natural Gas \u000aAll three produce carbon dioxide, coal produces the most (per unit energy), then oil, then natural gas, which contributes to global warming. \u000aAs of the year 2000, the United States used oil the most, then natural gas, and coal coming in a close third. China, on the other hand uses coal more than the other two fossil fuels. \u000aBecause of extraction, habitat destruction (see #2) is worst for coal, then oil and natural gas \u000aPollution reduction- burn and use less fuels, catalytic converters on cars to reduce NOx . Also industrial solutions include electrostatic precipitation, baghouse filter, cyclone separator, wet scrubber. These methods, however, are expensive and only divert the pollution problem by reducing air pollution, but not pollution as a whole. \u000aBasic Facts- all form from decayed plant and animal matter, and they are all nonrenewable; they do not renew themselves within 100 years. \u000aNatural Gas is "wave of the future" while coal is the "old skool fuel."

sV10 things to know about.... GLOBAL WARMING
p5669
VGREENHOUSE EFFECT- greenhouse gases O3, H2O and CO2 & (water vapor) cause heat from the sun to become trapped in the earth's atmosphere and produce a warming effect. More specifically, UV rays are emitted from the sun and are absorbed by the earth, which in turn produces IR (infrared) rays. These get trapped in the atmosphere causing heating. \u000aClimate change goes in cycles: A cold period - roughly 100,000 years ago, now -10,000-year-old "warm" period. \u000aScientists predict future climate change using mathematical models generated from supercomputers and general circulation models (GCMs), which are 3D representations of how energy, air mass, and moisture flow through the atmosphere because of their physical properties. \u000aPositive feedback loop exists with methane emissions in regard to permafrost and bogs. As permafrost melts and exposes methane-emitting bogs, the gas released by these areas continues the greenhouse effect and melts more permafrost. Similar patterns are seen with CO2 emissions. \u000aVegetation depletion leads to increased global warming, because trees are unable to sequester CO2 from the atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect. \u000aALBEDO- the earth's ability to reflect light. Reflected energy does not heat the earth's surface, and ice caps and other glacial regions have greatly increased albedo. Thus, the cooling effect of these areas is lost as they melt. POSITIVE FEEDBACK HIJINKS! \u000aThe majority of greenhouse gases are emitted from, among other things, burning of fossil fuels and deforestation. Natural sources can include regular ol' water evaporation, ozone, and CO2 due to respiration. \u000aOceans moderate temperature by removing 29% of earth's CO2 and absorb a great deal of excess heat. \u000aEffects on humans of global warming: \u000aDisease (respiratory illnesses and pathological diseases due to insects and other warm climate based carriers) \u000aDrought and flooding due to extreme weather patterns \u000aRising sea levels due to ice melting leads to destruction of homes \u000aHigher irrigation demands and more pests for agriculture \u000aNon-human effects of global warming: \u000aLoss of habitat for animals \u000aExtinctions \u000aChange in species location due to climate change \u000aSea temperature and level changes \u000aExtreme weather patterns \u000aMight lead to HYPER photosynthesis when soils and nutrients are also abundant.

sVNuclear power delivers energy more cleanly than fossil fuels
p6487
V- Using fission, nuclear power plants generate electricity w/o creating air pollution from stack emissions\u000a- in contrast, combusting fossil fuels can emit sulfur dioxide, which contributes to acid deposition; particulate matter, which treat hens human health; and carbon dioxide and other GHGs, which drive global climate change \u000a- for residents living downwind from power plants, scientists calculate that nuclear power poses far fewer chronic health risks from pollution than does fossil fuel combustion \u2014 and b/c uranium generates far more power than coal by weight or volume, less of it needs to be mined, so uranium mining causes less damage to landscapes and generates less solid waste than coal mining \u000a- nuclear power plants are safer for workers than are coal-fired plants \u000a- nuclear power has drawbacks: the waste it procures is radioactive \u2014 radioactive waste must be handled w/ great care and must be disposed of in a ways that minimizes danger to present and future generations; if an accident occurs at a power plant, or if a plant is sabotaged, the consequences can potentially be catastrophic \u000a- given this mix of advantages and disadvantages many governments have judged the good to outweigh the bad, and today the world has 439 operating nuclear plants in 30 nations

p6589
V- in developing nations, especially in rural areas, families gather fuelwood to burn in their homes for heating, cooking, and lighting\u000a- although fossil fuels are replacing traditional energy sources as developing nations industrialize, fuelwood, charcoal, and manure still account for fully 35% of energy use in these nations \u2014 up to 90% in the poorest nations \u000a- fuelwood and other traditional biomass sources constitute nearly 80% of all renewable energy used worldwide \u2014 however biomass is renewable only if it is not over harvested \u2014 harvesting fuelwood at unsustainable rapid rates can lead to deforestation, soil erosion, and desertification, thereby damaging landscapes, diminishing biodiversity, and impoverishing human societies \u000a- heavily populated arid regions that support meter woodlands are most vulnerable to over harvesting, and these include many regions of Africa and Asia \u2014 another drawback of burning fuelwood and other biomass in traditional ways for cooking and heating is that it leads to health hazards from indoor air pollution

sVChernobyl saw the worst accident yet
p6761
V- Engineers had turned off safety systems to conduct tests, and human error, combined w/ unsafe reactor design, led to explosions that destroyed the reactor and sent clouds of radioactive debris billowing into the atmosphere \u000a- for 10 days radiation escaped from the plant while emergency crews risked their lives putting out fires \u000a- most residents of the surrounding countryside remained t home for these 10 days, exposed to radiation, before the Soviet government belatedly began evacuating more than 100,000 people \u000a- in the months and years afterwards, workers erected a gigantic concrete sarcophagus around the demolished reactor, scrubbed buildings and roads, and removed irradiated materials \u2014 however, the landscape for at least 30 km around the plant remains contaminated, the demolished reactor is still full of dangerous fuels and debris, and radioactivity leaks from the hastily built and quickly deteriorating sarcophagus \u000a- the accident killed 31 people directly and screened or caused cancer in thousands more \u2014 exact numbers are uncertain b/c of inadequate data and the difficulty of determining long-term radiation effects \u000a- health authorities estimate that most of the over 4,000 cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed in people who were children at the time resulted from radioactive iodine spread by the accident \u000a- atmospheric currents carried radioactive fallout from Chernobyl across much of the Northern Hemisphere, particularly Ukraine, Belarus, and parts of Russia and Europe \u2014 fallout was the greatest where rainstorms brought radioisotopes down from the radioactive cloud \u000a- as plants around the world age, they require more maintenance and are therefore less safe

p7077
V- measures enacted by the U.S. government in response to that even included a mandated increase in the miles-per-gallon fuel efficiency of automobiles and a reduction in the national speed limit to 55 miles per hour \u000a- over the next three decades, many of the conservation initiatives that followed the oil crises were abandoned \u2014 w/o high market prices and an immediate threat of shortages, people lacked economic motivation to conserve \u2014 government funding for research into alternative energy sources decreased, speed limits increased, and U.S. policymakers repeatedly failed to raise the corporate average fuel efficiency (CAFE) standards, which set benchmarks for auto manufacturers to meet \u000a- the U.S has also kept its taxes on gasoline extremely low, relative to other nations \u2014 americans pay two to three times less per gallon of gas than drivers in many European countries \u2014 this means that gasoline prices do not account of the substantial external costs that oil production and consumption impost on society, and ti also diminishes our economic incentives to conserve \u000a- in 2009, the U.S. government under President Obama sought to improve automobile fuel efficiency while stimulating economic activity and saving jobs during a severe recession \u2014 "Cash for Clunkers" program \u2014 paid Americans each to turn in old vehicles and purchase newer, more fuel-efficient ones

sVSummary of the Case Study "San Diego and Tijuana: Sewage Pollution Problems and Policy Solutions"
p7859
VThe beaches south of San Diego are known to have some of the best surfing waves in the world, but people avoid them because of the Tijuana River, which flows across the Mexican border and into the sea, polluting the ocean water. This is caused by rainwater that falls and causes debris to clog the sewage drains in Mexico, causing the pollution and waste to flow into the streets and then into the river. In 2007, beaches were closed 27 times, of which 76% were due to pollution. The Tijuana's riverside covers 1,750 square miles of land and his home to 2 million people (it is a transboundary watershed). This problem has worsened as population grows. The effects are even worse for the Mexican residents because they are more impoverished than those on the US side. Today, the US and Mexico are working together to reduce the pollution.

p8415
VHuman waste disposal is such an issue because it's not disposed of properly, then it could cause lots of problems for the environment and unsanitary conditions leading to unpleasant circumstances and possibly diseases. More than 500 pathogenic bacteria viruses and parasites can travel to human or animal excrement through water. In an area with low population natural processes can quickly eliminate waste but in a city like Mexico City it is not so easy. In fact Dust in Mexico City is actually dried feces. Using waste called night soil like in Asia is spread on the fields as fertilizer but this can cause diseases. And example of improper human waste disposal is the use of outhouses which led to contaminated drinking water supplies. This issue is treated in different ways. The use of septic fields clean water by aereation and removed excess nutrients through bacterial action, solids are pumped out and taking to a treatment plant. Nother solution includes sewage treatment which involves three steps. A low-cost waste treatment is a hybrid between the septic tank in the full sewer system also wetlands can be used

p8691
V- wind power produces no emissions once the equipment is manufactured and installed \u000a- wind power, under optimal conditions, appears considerably more efficient than conventional power sources in its energy returned on investment\u000a- wind turbine technology can be used on many scaled, from a single tower for local use to fields of hundreds that supply large regions \u000a- small-scale turbine development can help make local areas more self-sufficient \u000a- another benefit of wind power is that farmers and ranchers can lease their land for wind development, which provides them extra revenue while also increasing property tax income for rural communities \u2014 b/c each turbine takes up only a small area, most of the land can still be used for farming, ranching, or other uses\u000a- financially, wind power involves up-front costs for erecting turbines and expanding infrastructure to allow electricity distribution, but over the lifetime of a project it requires only maintenance costs \u2014 unlike fossil fuel power plants, wind turbines incur no ongoing fuel costs \u000a- startup costs of wind farms generally are higher than those of fossil-fuel plants, but wind farms incur fewer expenses once they are up and running \u2014 moreover, advancing technology is driving down the costs, per unit of electricity produced of wind farm construction\u000a- wind power produces jobs

VThe housing on top of a wind turbine that contains the generator and other equipment
p8774
sVWind turbines convert kinetic energy to electrical energy
p8775
V- wind blowing into a turbine turns the blades of the rotor, which rotate machinery inside a compartment called a nacelle, which sits atop a tall tower \u000a- inside the nacelle are a gearbox and a generator, as well as equipment to monitor and control the turbine's activity\u000a- higher is generally better, to minimize turbulence while maximizing wind speed \u000a- turbines are often erected in groups called wind parks or wind farms \u000a- engineers design turbines to yaw, or rotate back and forth in response to changes in wind direction, ensuring that the motor faces into the wind at all times \u2014 also design them to being turning at specific wind speeds to harness wind energy as efficiently as possible \u000a- some turbines generate low levels of electricity by turning in light breezes \u2014 others are programmed to rotate only in strong winds, operating less frequently but generating large amounts of electricity in short time periods\u000a- slight differences in wind speed yield substantial differences in power output, for two reasons \u2014 first the energy content of wind increases as the square of its velocity, thus if wind velocity doubles, energy quadruples \u2014 second an increase in wind speed causes more air molecules to pass through the wind turbine power unit time, making power output equal to wind velocity cubed \u2014 thus a doubled wind velocity actually results in an eightfold increase in power output

p9941
V- W/ improved technology for sorting rubbish and recyclables, many businesses and entrepreneurs are weighing the economic benefits and costs of rummaging through landfills and salvaging materials of value that can be recycled \u000a- steel, aluminum, copper, and other metals are abundant enough in some landfills to make such salvage operations profitable when market prices for the metals are high enough \u000a- besides metals, landfills offer organic waste that can be mined and sold as premium compost \u000a- Old landfill waste can be incinerated in newer, cleaner-burning WTE facilities to produce energy \u000a- some companies are looking into gaining carbon credits by harvesting methane lacking form huge open dumps in developing nations in Asia and Africa\u000a- such approaches have been tried in places and they can be profitable when market prices are high enough \u2014 however, the costs of mining landfills and meeting regulatory requirements while commodity prices change unpredictably have meant that investing in landfill mining has been risky so far \u2014 could change if prices rise and technologies improve

V- since climate change is a global climate \u2014 global commitment is needed to forge effective solutions \u2014 why the world's policymakers have tried to tackle climate change by means of international treaties \u000a- in 1992 @ the U.N. Conference on Environmental & Development Earth Summit in Rio de Janerio, Brazil, most of the world's nations signed the U.N Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) \u2014 this agreement outlined a plan for reducing GHG emissions to 1990 levels by the 2000 through a voluntary, nation-by-nation approach \u000a- by the late 90s, it was clear that a voluntary approach was not succeeding \u2014 nations of the developing world helped create a biding international treaty that would require emissions reductions \u2014 an outgrowth of the FCCC drafted in '97 in Kyoto, Japan, the Kyoto Protocol mandates signatory nations, by the period 2008-2012, to reduce missions of six GHGs to levels below those of 1990 \u000a- the U.S. refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol & remains the only developed nation not to join this international effort \u2014 U.S. leaders who oppose the Kyoto Protocol call the treaty unfair b/c it requires industrialized nations to reduced emissions but does not require the same of rapidly industrializing nations such as China & India, whose GHGs emissions have risen over 50% in the past 15 years \u2014 the U.S. emits 1/5 of the world's GHGs, so its refusal has generated widespread resentment & has undercut the effectiveness of global efforts

p10309
V- for many years we discarded hazardous waste w/o special treatment \u000a- in many cases, people did not know that certain substances were harmful to human health\u000a- in other case, the danger posed by these substances was known or suspected, but it was assumed that the substances would disappear or be sufficiently diluted in the environment \u000a- many communities have designated sites or special collection days to gather household hazardous waste, or have designated facilities for the exchange and reuse of substances \u2014 once consolidated in such sites, the waste is transported for treatment and ultimate disposal \u000a- Under RCRA, the EPA sets standards by which states are to manage hazard waste \u2014 also requires large generators of hazardous waste to obtain permits and mandates that hazard materials be tracked "from cradle to grave". \u000a- As hazardous waste is generated, transported, and deposed of, the producer, carrier, and disposal facility must each report to the EPA the type and amount of material generated; its location, origin, and destination; and the way it is being handled \u2014 intended to prevent illegal dumping and to encourage the use of reputable waste carrier and disposal facilities\u000a- b/c current U.S. law makes disposing of hazardous waste quite costly, irresponsible companies sometimes illegally dup waste, creating health risks for residents and financial headaches for local governments forced to deal w/ the mess\u000a- hazardous waste from industrialized nations is sometimes dumped illegally in developing nations \u2014 a major environmental justice issue \u2014 occurs despite the Basel Convention, an international treaty to prevent this practice \u000a- high costs of disposal have also encouraged conscientious businesses to invest in reducing their hazardous waste \u000a- many biologically hazardous materials can be broken down by incineration at high temperatures in cement kilns\u000a- some hazardous materials can be treated by exposure to bacteria that break down harmful components and synthesize them into new components \u000a- various plants have been bred or engineered to take up specific contaminants from soil and then break down organic contaminants into safer compounds or concentrate heavy metals in their tissues

V- incineration was initially practiced simply to reduce the volume of waste, but today it often serves to generate electricity as well \u000a- most North Americans incinerators now are waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities that use the heat produced by waste combustion to boil water, creating steam the drives electricity generation or that fuels heating systems \u000a- revenues from power generation are usually not enough to offset the considerable financial cost of building and running incinerators \u2014 b/c it can take many years for a WTE facility to become profitable, many companies that build and operate these facilities require communities contracting w/ them to guarantee the facility a minimum amount of garbage

sVPhotovoltaic cell generate electricity directly
p11505
V- The most direct way to produce electricity from sunlight involves photovoltaic systems\u000a- Photovoltaic cells conner sunlight to electrical energy by making use of the photovoltaic effect \u2014 occurs when light reaches the PV cell and stakes one of a pair of plates made primarily of silicon, a semiconductor that conducts electricity \u2014 the light causes one plat to release electrons, which are attracted by electrostatic forces to the opposing plate \u2014 connecting the two plates w/ wires enables the electrons to flow back to the original plate, creating an electrical current which can be converted into alternating current and used for residential and commercial electrical power \u000a- PV cells are arranged in modules, which comprise panels, which can be gathered together in arrays \u000a- researchers are experimenting w/ further variations on PV technology, and manufacturers today are already developing thin-film solar cells, photovoltaic materials compressed into ultra-thin sheets \u2014 are lightweight and far less bulky than the standard crystalline silicon cells \u2014 although less efficient at converting sunlight to electricity, they are cheaper to produce \u2014 thin-film technologies can be incorporated into roofing shingles and potentially many other types of surfaces \u000a- photovoltaic cells of all types can be connected to batteries that store the accumulated change until it is need \u000a- or, producers of PV electricity can sell their power to their local utility if they are connected to the regional electrical grid\u000a- homeowners can sell power to their utility in a process called net-metering, which the value of the power the consumer produces is subtracted from the consumers' monthly utility bill \u000a- feed-in tariffs generally offer power-producers the hope of turning a profit

V- it would be a mistake to assume that all artificial substances are unhealthy and that all natural substances are healthy\u000a- the amount of synthetic chemicals in our food from pesticide residues are dwarfed by the quantities of natural toxicants \u000a- f fears of pesticide residues, or price increases resulting from their removal cause people to eat fewer fruits and vegetables, then people will be at greater risk for disease, b/c a balance diet rich in fruits and vegetables is important for health \u000a- The Ames test, a bacterial assay for mutagens, allows easy screening of suspected toxins \u2014 Ames is a target of criticism from environmental advocate who' say that synthetic toxicants 1: are harder for the body to metabolize and excrete more than natural ones, 2: persist and accumulate in the environment, and 3: expose people to risks in ways other than the ingestion of food

p11967
Vhydronium concentration: p^-pH\u000ahyrdoxide concentration p^-pOH\u000apH+pOH= 14\u000apH denotes whether a substance is an acid or a base. It is a logarithmic scale, so a pH of 4 is ten times more acidic than a pH of 5, and 100 times more acidic than a pH of 6.\u000a\u000aThe pH number can also help us figure out how much hydronium ions (H+ ions, also can be shown as H3O+ ions) are in a substance. \u000a\u000aExample: an acid with a pH of 2 will have 1x10^-2 hydronium mol/L ions in it (just take the pH number of 2 and put it in the exponent) Since the pH scale is 0-14, and hydronium (H+) and hydroxide (OH-) ions must multiply to 1X10^-14, you can just subract 2 from 14 and get the hydroxide concentration of 1X10^-12.

sVIndustrial ecology seeks to make industry more sustainable
p12325

p12455
V- as earth's surface absorbs solar radiation, the surface increases in temperature & emits infrared radiation \u2014 infrared radiation has longer wavelengths than the visible & ultraviolet light that had arrived from the sun & passes through the atmosphere \u2014 atmospheric gases having three or more atoms in their molecules tend to absorb this infrared radiation very effectively \u2014 include: water vapor, ozone, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, & methane, as well as halocarbons, a diverse group of mostly human-made gases that includes CFCs \u2014 greenhouse gases \u2014 after absorbing radiation emitted from the surface, greenhouses gases subsequently re-emit infrared radiation in all directions, some of this energy is lost into space, but some travels back downward, warming the atmosphere & the planet's surface in a phenomenon known as the greenhouse effect \u000a- the greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon & greenhouse gases have been present in our atmosphere for all of Earth's history \u2014 w/o the natural greenhouse effect, our planet would be too cold to support life \u2014 it is not the natural greenhouse effect that conner scientists today, but rather the anthropogenic intensification of the greenhouse effect \u2014 by adding novel greenhouse gases to the atmosphere, & by increasing the concentration of several natural greenhouse gases over the past 250-300 years, we are intensifying our planet's greenhouse effect beyond what our species has ever experienced \u000a- greenhouse gases differ in their ability to warm the troposphere & surface \u000a- global warming potential refers to the relative ability of one molecule of a given greenhouse gas to contribute to warming \u000a- Values are expressed in relation to carbon dioxide, which is assigned a global warming potential of 1 \u2014 thus, a molecule of methane is 25 times as potent as a molecule of carbon dioxide, & molecule of nitrous oxide is 298 times as potent as a carbon dioxide molecule

V- we can also reduce GHG emissions by switching to clean energy sources \u000a- alternatives to fossil fuels include nuclear power, biomass energy, hydroelectric power, geothermal power, photovoltaic cells, wind power, & ocean sources \u2014 these energy sources give off no net emissions during their use\u000a- b/c our society is not ready to transition fully to these alternatives, we also need to consider the ways we use fossil fuels \u2014 switching from coal to natural gas is a step in the right direction, b/c natural gas produces the same amt of energy as coal, w/ roughly 1/2 of emissions \u000a- currently, interest in carbon capture & storage is intensifying. Carbon capture refers to technologies or approaches that remove carbon dioxide from power plant emissions \u2014 successful carbon capture would allow facilities to continued using fossil fuels while cutting GHG pollution \u000a- the next step is carbon sequestration or carbon storage, in which the carbon is sequestered, or stored, underground under pressure in rock formations where it will not seep out \u2014 depleted oil & gas deposits & deep salt mines are examples of the kinds of underground reservoirs being considered \u2014 however, we are still a long way from developing adequate technology & secure storage space to accomplish this w/o leakage

sVNatural gas is formed in two ways
p12683
V- Natural gas consists primarily of methane, CH4, and typically includes varying amounts of other volatile hydrocarbons \u000a- Biogenic gas is created at shallow depths by the anaerobic decompositions of organic matter by bacteria \u2014 "swamp gas" \u2014 as organic matter buried more deeply, the pressure exerted by overlying sediments grows, and temperatures increase \u2014 carbon bonds in the organic matter begin breaking, and the organic matter turns to a substance called kerogen, which acts as a source material for both natural gas and curse oil \u2014 further heat and pressure air on the kerogen to degrade complex organic molecules into simpler hydrocarbon molecules \u2014 at depths below 3 km, the high temperatures and pressure tend to form natural gas \u2014 whereas biogenic gas i nearly pure methane, thermogenic has contains small mounts of other gases as well as methane \u000a- Thermogenic gas may be formed directly, along w/ coal or crude oil, or from coal or oil that is alter by heating \u2014 most gas extracted commercially is thermogenic and is found above deposits of crude oil or seams of coal, so its extraction often accompanies the extraction of those fossil fuels \u000a- natural gas goes to waste as it escapes from coal mines or oil wells \u2014 methane from coal seams, called coal-bed methane, commonly leaks to the atmosphere during mining \u2014 to avoid this waste, and b/c methane is a potent GHG that contributes to climate change, mining engineers now try to capture more of this gas for energy \u2014 in remote oil-drilling areas, where transporting natural gas is prohibitively expensive, natural gas is flared\u000a- one source of biogenic natural gas is the decay process in landfills, and many landfills operators are now capturing this gas to see as fuel \u2014 decreases energy waste, can be profitable for the operator, and helps reduce the atmosphere release of methane

sVWe drill to extract oil
p13223
V- once geologists have identified a promising location for an oil depots, an oil company will typically conduct exploratory drilling \u2014 exploratory holes are usually small in circumference but descent to great depths \u2014 if enough oil is encountered, extraction begins \u2014 pressure is required to extract oil from porous rock \u2014 oil is typically already under pressure \u2014 from above by rock or trapped gas dissolved in the oil \u2014 al these forces are held in place by surrounding rock until drilling reaches the deposit, whereupon oil will often rise to the surface of its own accord \u000a- once pressure is relieved and some oil has risen to the surface, the remaining oil becomes more difficult to extract and may need to be pumped out \u2014 after pumping, a great deal of oil remains stuck to rock surfaces \u2014 as much as 2/3 of a deposit may remain in the ground after primary extraction, the initial drilling and pumping of available oil \u000a- companies may then begin secondary extraction, in which solvents are used or underground rocks are flushed w/ water or steam to remove additional oil \u000a- even after secondary extraction, quite a bit of oil can remain; we lack the technology to remove every last drop \u2014 secondary extraction is more expensive then primary extraction when they were first drilled b/c the price of oil was too low to make the procedure economical

sVBreeder reactors make better use of fuel, but have raised safety concerns
p13235
V- using 235-U as fuel for fission is only one potential way to harness nuclear energy \u000a- breeder reactors make use of 238-U, which in conventional fission goes unused as a waste product\u000a- in breeder reactors, the addition of a neutron to 238-U and its subsequent electron loss forms plutonium \u000a- when plutonium is bombarded by a neutron, it splits into fission products and releases more neutrons, which convert more of the remaining 238-U fuel into 239-Pu, continuing the process\u000a- b/c 99% of all uranium is 238-U, fission in breeder reactors makes much better use of fuel, generates far more power, and produces far less waste \u000a- breeder reactors are more dangerous than conventional reactors b/c highly reactive liquid sodium, rather than water is used as a coolant, raising the risk of explosive accidents \u000a- breeder reactors also are more expensive than conventional reactors \u000a- breeder reactors can be used to supply plutonium to nuclear weapons programs \u2014 all but a handful of the world's breeder reactors have now been shut down

sVRegulation and economics each influence industrial waste generation
p13293
V- most methods and strategies of waste disposal, reduction, and recycling by industry are similar to those for municipal solid waste\u000a- businesses that manage their own waste on site generally dispose of it in landfills, and companies must design and manage their landfills in ways that meet state, local, or tribal guidelines \u000a- other businesses pay to have their waste disposed of at municipal disposal sites\u000a- regulation varies greatly from state to state and area to area, but in most cases, state and local regulation of industrial solid waste is less strict than federal regulation of municipal solid waste \u000a- in many areas, industries are not required to have permits, install liners or leachate collection systems, or monitor groundwater for contamination \u000a- the amount of waste generated by a manufacturing process is good measure of its efficiency \u000a- the less waste produced, the more efficient that process is, from a physical standpoint \u000a- but, physical efficiency is not always reflected in economic efficiency \u2014 it is cheaper for industry to manufacture its products or perform its services quickly but messily\u000a- that is, it can be cheaper to generate waste than to avoid generating waste \u000a- economic efficiency is maximized, but physical efficiency is not \u000a- b/c our market system award only economic efficiency, all to often industry has not financial incentive to achieve physical efficiency \u000a- the frequent mismatch b/w these two types of efficiency is major reason why the output of industrial waste is so great \u000a- rising costs of waste disposal enhance the financial incentive to decrease waste and increase physical efficiency \u000a- one wither government or the market makes the physically efficient use of raw materials economically efficient, businesses have financial incentives to reduce their own waste

V- b/c crude oil is a complex mix of hydrocarbons, we can create types of petroleum products by separating its various components \u2014 what takes place at an oil refinery \u000a- the many types of hydrocarbon molecules in crude oil have carbon chains of different lengths \u2014 a chain's length affects its chemical properties, and this has consequences for our use, such s whether a give fuel burns cleanly in a car engine \u000a- through the process of refining, hydrocarbons molecules are separated into different size classes and are chemically transformed to create specialized fuels for heating, cooking, and transportation, and to create lubricating oils, asphalts, and the precursors of plastics and other petrochemical products \u000a- since the 1920s, refining techniques and chemical manufacturing have greatly expanded our uses of petroleum to include a wide array of products and applications, from lubricants to plastics to fabrics to pharmaceuticals \u000a- today, petroleum-based products are all around us in our everyday lives \u2014 b/c petroleum products have become so central to or lives, many fossil fuels experts today are voicing concern that oil production may soon decline as we continue to deplete the world's recoverable oil reserves.

Mercury is also stored in fat/muscle so it cannot be easily removed by bodily enzymes, so these older fish will not loose the mercury they have accumulated\u000a4.

p13707
V- wind is an intermittent resource; we have no control over when wind will occur, and this unpredictability is a major limitation in relying on it as an electricity source \u000a- this poses little problem if wind is one of several sources contributing to a utility's power generation \u2014 moreover, batteries or hydrogen fuel can store energy generated by wind and release it later when needed \u000a- wind varies from place to place; some areas are windier than others \u000a- global wind patterns combine w/ local topography to create local wind patterns\u000a- resource planners and wind power companies study these patterns closely before planning a wind farm \u000a- meteorological research has given us information w/ which to judge prime areas for locating wind farms \u000a- good wind resources are not always near populations centers that need the energy\u000a- when wind farms are proposed near population centers, local residents often oppose them \u000a- turbines are generally located in exposed, conspicuous sites, and some people object to wind farms for aesthetic reasons, feeling that the structure clutter the landscape \u2014 which elect not-in-my-backyard (NIMBY) syndrome among people living nearby \u000a- wind turbines also pose a threat to birds and bats, which are killed when they fly into the rotating blades \u2014 bat mortality appears to be a more severe problem, and more research is urgently needed \u2014 one key for protecting birds and bats may be selecting sites that are not migratory flyways or in the midst of prime habitat for species that are likely to fly into the blades

The FWS maintains a worldwide list of endangered species. Species include birds, insects, fish, reptiles, mammals, crustaceans, flowers, grasses, and trees.\u000aThe law requires federal agencies, in consultation with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and/or the NOAA Fisheries Service, to ensure that actions they authorize, fund, or carry out are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species or result in the destruction or adverse modification of designated critical habitat of such species. The law also prohibits any action that causes a "taking" of any listed species of endangered fish or wildlife. Likewise, import, export, interstate, and foreign commerce of listed species are all.

p16932
V- island biogeography theory \u2014 introduced by E.O. Wilson and ecologist Robert MacArthur in 1963, this theory explains how species come to be distributed among oceanic islands \u2014 researchers have applied it to "habitat islands"\u2014 patches of one habitat type isolated within "seas" of others\u000a- Island biogeography theory explains how the number of species on an island results from a balance between the number added by immigration & the number lost through extirpation \u2014 predicts an island's species richness based on the island's size & its distance from the mainland: the farther an island lies from a continent, the fewer species tend to find & colonize it \u2014 thus, remote islands host few species b/c of low immigration rates \u2014 distance effect; larger islands have higher immigration rates b/c they present fatter targets for dispersing organisms to encounter; larger islands have lower extinction rate b/c more space allows for larger populations, which are less likely to drop to zero by chance \u000a - the latter two trends give large islands more species than small islands \u2014 a phenomenon called the area effect \u000a- large islands also contain more species b/c they tend to possess more habitats than smaller islands, providing suitable environments for a wider variety of species \u2014 the number of species on an islands is expected to double as island size increases tenfold \u2014 illustrated by species-are curves\u000a- Small "islands" of forest loss diversity fastest, starting w/ large species that were few in number to begin with

sVThe new renewables are growing fast
p18178
V- the new renewable energy sources are growing at much faster rates then are conventional energy sources\u000a- over the past four decades, solar, wind, and geothermal energy sources have grown far faster than has the overall energy supply\u000a- the leader in growth is wind power, which has expanded by nearly 50% each year since the 1970s \u000a- b/c these sources started from such low levels of use, it will take them some time to catch up to conventional sources \u2014 the absolute amount of energy added by a 50% increase in wind power today equals the amount added by just a 1% increase in oil, coal, or natural gas \u000a- use of new renewables has been expanding quickly b/c of growing concern over diminishing fossil fuel supplies and b/c of the environmental and health impacts of fossil fuel combustion \u000a- advances in technology are also making it easier and less expensive to harness renewable energy sources\u000a- the new renewable promise several benefits over fossil fuels \u2014 they help alleviate air pollution and the GHG emissions that drive global climate change haustible on any time scale relevant to our society \u2014 developing renewables can diversify an economy's mix go energy, helping to reduce price volatility and buffer use against supply restrictions \u2014 finally, novel energy sources can create new employment opportunities and sources of income and property tax for communities, especially in rural areas passed over by other economic development \u000a- new and developing technologies generally require more labor per unit of energy output than do established technologies, so shifting to renewable energy should generate employment \u000a- the design, installation, maintenance, and management required to develop technologies and rebuild and operate our society's energy infrastructure promises to be a major source of employment for young people today, through so-called green-collar jobs \u000a- rapid growth in renewable energy sectors seems likely to continue as populations and consumptions grow, global energy demand expands, fossil fuel supplies decline, and people demanded cleaner environments

sV10 Things to know about mining
p18502
V1. The environmental reclamation of coal mining sites is controlled by the federal government through the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977 This law created two programs, one for regulating active coal mines and one for reclaiming abandoned mines for whom no party could be held legally responsible (such as when the mining company has gone bankrupt). 2.Mining is the extraction of valuable minerals or other geological materials from the earth, usually from an ore body, vein or (coal) seam. 3.Placer mining involves any type of mining where raw minerals are depostied in sand or gravel or on the surface and are picked up without having to drive, use dynamite or any other signifigant means. Ex. panning for gold in a stream bed 4.Open pit mines involve digging large open holes in the ground as opposed to a small shaft in hard rock mining. This method of mining is most often used with minerals like copper and molybdenum. Open pit mines are very large and devistate the surrounding landscape. 5.Strip mining is a form of surface mining. The ore is close to the surface of the land but has one or more layers of rock and dirt on top of it. To mine the ore, these layers have to be taken off causing overburden. Coal in TN is mines by contour strip mining 6. Room and pillar mining: This is used in mining minerals such as Diamonds , silver, and sometimes coal. There are intersecting 'rooms' with pillars of coal or rock that hold up the roof. These pillars are mined last when the mine, or a part of it, is closing. They are careful when they do this because the roof caves in as they leave. 7. Longwall mining: Usually a machine called a continuous miner slices layers of minerals from the walls and lets the rocks fall onto a conveyor belt to be taken out of the mine. 8. There can be massive "cons" to the environment - the processing of the ore can require a chemical process - Gold mining for example cyanide heap leaching 9. Cons: Acid mine drainage; subsedience; habitat loss, erosion, spoil piles, slag piles, overburden refuse, loss of topsoil; dangerous to miners- black lung, carbon monoxide, radon \u000a 10. West Virginia coal mining accident 2010 - methane explosion and combustable coal dust - 28 killed

sVDistinguish photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and chemosynthesis, and summarize their importance to living things.
p21464
VPhotosynthesis is the process when autotrophs (plants, bacteria, etc.) turn light energy from the sun into chemical energy. The sunlight powers a series of chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and water into sugars, transforming diffuse energy from the sun into concentrated energy the organism can use. Cellular Respiration is when the organisms make use of the chemical energy created by photosynthesis (it is vital to life). It releases water and carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Chemosynthesis is the process in which bacteria uses the chemical-bond energy of hydrogen sulfide to transform inorganic carbon into organic carbon compounds (it does this when it is lacking sunlight for photosynthesis and needs to produce energy). These processes are all important because they are the basis for plants survival on this earth, and the processes result in water and carbon dioxide being released into the air which is something that all living things need in order to breath

sVFossil fuels are indeed fuels created from "fossils"
p21494
V- fossil fuels are formed from the tissues of organisms that lived 100-500 million years ago \u2014 the energy these fuels contain came originally from the sun and was converted to chemical-bond energy as a result of photosynthesis \u000a- the chemical energy in these organisms' tissues then became concentrated as these tissues decomposed and their hydrocarbon compounds were altered and compressed \u000a- most organisms, after death, do not end up as part of a coal, gas, or oil deposits \u2014 a tree that falls and decays as a rotting log undergoes mostly aerobic decomposition; in the presence of air bacteria and other organisms that use oxygen break down plant and animal remains into simpler carbon molecules that are recycled through the ecosystem \u000a- fossil fuels are produced only when organic material is broken down in an anaerobic environment, one that has little or no oxygen (deep lakes, swamps, and shallow seas) \u000a- in any given location different fuels may form, depending on 1) the chemical compositions of the starting material, 2) the temperatures and pressures to which the material is subjected, 3) the presence of absence of anaerobic decomposers, and 4) the passage of time

sV10 things to Know about the Water Cycle
p21582
VThe Water Cycle- Collects, purifies, and distributes all the world's water \u000aPhases\u000a1. Evaporation- Conversion of water to vapor.\u000a2. Transpiration- Conversion of water to vapor from plants.\u000a3. Condensation- Process by which a gas or vapor converts to a liquid. (No solid surface needed.)\u000a4. Precipitation- Falling of water in any form to earth.\u000a5. Infiltration- When water firsts enters the ground.\u000a6. Percolation- Process of water seeping through ground.\u000a7. Runoff- Rainfall not absorbed by soil which collects in other bodies of water.\u000a\u000a8. Water cycle drives all other cycles as a medium of transport.\u000a\u000a9. Powered by sun and gravity\u2014the sun plays a role in evaporation, transpiration, and everything else in life. Gravity plays a part in the fall of water downward to the ground (as well as under the ground)--it would be hard to achieve without gravity.\u000a\u000a10. Absolute Humidity: Amount of water vapor found in certain masses of air. Measured in grams of h20/grams of air.\u000aRelative Humidity: % maximum amount of humidity that could be held at the temperature\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000a11. Dew Point- Temperature at which condensation occurs.\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aIs water a renewable or nonrenewable resource?\u000a\u000aRenewable- when it cycles through in less than 100 years (example water sitting on a road on a sunny day after a storm) \u000aNonrenewable- when trapped in places for more 100 years (such as polar ice caps and underground)

p22576
VWhile looking at a graph of biochemical oxygen demand the various life forms that live in the rivers and lakes are affected by the distance from the point source solution. In the area right before the point source solution is called a clean zone where are dissolved oxygen levels are healthy, therefore we see trout, perch, bass, mayfly, stonefly and caddis fly larvae. Then we see the decomposition zone where fewer organisms inhabit. The oxygen levels are not as great as the queen zone so we see organisms like rough fish or leeches inhabiting this zone. The least life seen is directly where the point source solution comes from and the oxygen sag, called the septic zone. This zone has the lowest oxygen levels and therefore fish are absent and sludge warms and mosquito larvae thrive. As we distance ourselves from the septic zone we approach the recovery zone. This zone is similar to the decomposition zone, where inhabitants include rough fish and leeches. Finally far enough away from the points pollution, we arrive in the green zone where various lifeforms begin to thrive \u000aagain

sVPersonal choice and increased efficiency are two routes to conservation
p23749
V- energy conservation can be accomplished in two primary ways \u2014 as individuals, we can make conscious choices to reduce our own energy consumption by driving less, turning off lights when rooms ware not being used, dialing down thermostats, and cutting back on the use of energy-intensive machines and appliances \u2014 can help save money while also conserve resources \u000a- As a society, we can conserve energy by making our energy-consuming devices and processes more efficient \u2014 more than 2/3 of the fossil fuel energy we use is simply lost, as waste heat, in automobiles and power plants \u000a- in the case of automobiles, we already posses the technology to increase fuel efficiency far above the current U.S. average of 21 mpg -- we can accomplish this w/ more efficient gasoline engines; lightweight materials, continuously variable transmissions; and alternative technology vehicles \u000a- we can also vastly improve the efficiency of our power plants \u2014 cogeneration: excess heat produced during the generation of electricity is captures and used to heat nearby workplaces and homes and to produce other kinds of power \u2014 can almost double the efficiency of a power plant \u2014 the same is true of coal gasification and combined cycle generation \u2014 in this process, coal is treated to create hot gases that turn a gas turbine, while the hot exhaust of this turbine heats water to drive a conventional steam turbine \u000a- in homes and public building, a significant amount of heat is lost during the winter and gained during the summer b/c of inadequate insulation \u2014 improvements in the design go homes and offices can reduce the energy required to heat and cool them \u2014 such design changes can involve the buildings's location, the color of its roof, and its insulation \u000a- among consumer products, scores of appliances, from refrigerators to lightbulbs, have been reengineered through the ears to increase energy efficiency

p24127
V- computers, printers, cell phones, handheld devices, TVs, DVD players, fax machines, MP3 players, and other electronic technology has created a substantial new source of waste \u000a- these products have short lifetimes before people judge them obsolete and most are discarded after only a few years \u2014 the amount o this electronic waste \u2014 E-Waste is growing rapidly \u000a- Of these, half have been disposed of, about 40% are still begin used, and 10% are in storage\u000a- of the electronic items we discard, roughly four of five go to landfills and incinerators, where they have traditionally been treated as conventional solid waste \u2014 but, most electronic products contain heavy metals and toxic flame retardants, and recent research suggest that e-waste should instead be treated as hazardous waste\u000a- the EPA and a number of states are now taking steps to keep e-waste out of conventional sanitary landfills and incinerators and instead treat it as hazardous waste\u000a- more and more e-waste today is being recycled \u2014 the devices are taken apart, and parts and materials are refurbished and reused in new products \u2014 but, so many more items have been manufactured each year that the amount of e-waste we sent to landfills and incinerators in that time period increased by a greater amount \u000a- besides keeping toxic substances out of our environment, e-waste recycling is beneficial b/c a number of trace metals used in electronics are globally rare, so they can be lucrative to recover \u000a- every bit of metal we can recycle from a manufactured item is bit of metal we don't need to mien form the ground, so "mining" e-waste for precious metals helps reduce the environmental impacts that mining exerts \u000a- there are serious concerns about the health risks that recycling may pose to workers doing the disassembly \u2014 wealthy nations ship much of their e-waste to developing countries, where low-income workers disassemble the devices and handle toxic materials w/ minimal safety regulations \u2014 these environmental justice concerns need to be resolved, but if electronic recycling can be done responsibly, it seems likely to be the way of the future \u000a- in many north american cities, used electronic tare collected by businesses, nonprofit organizations, or municipals services, and are processed for reuse or recycling

p24181
V- many thousands of former military and industrial sites remain contaminated w/ hazardous waste in the U.S. and virtually every other nations on earth \u000a- for most nations, dealing w/ these messes is simply too difficult, time-consuming and expensive \u000a- in 1980, the U.S. Congress passed Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) \u2014 established a federal program to clean up U.S. sites polluted w/ hazardous waste from past activities \u000a- the EPA administers this clean up program, called the Superfund \u000a- under EPA auspices, experts identify sites polled w/ hazardous chemicals, take action to protect groundwater near these sites and clean up the pollution \u2014 later laws also charge the EPA w/ cleaning up brownfield, lands whose reuse or development are complicated by the presence of hazardous materials \u000a- once a Superfund site is identified, EPA scientists evaluate how close the site is to human habitation, whiter wastes are currently confined or likely to spread, and whether the site threatens drinking water supplies \u000a- sites that appear harmful are placed on the EPA's National Priority List, ranked according to the level of risk to human health that they pose \u000a- Cleanup proceeds on a site-by-site basis as funds are available \u000a- throughout the process, the EPA is required to hold public hearing to inform area residents of its findings and to receive feedback \u000a- The objective of CERCLA was to charge the polluting parties for cleanup of their sites, according to the polluter-pays principle \u2014 for many sites, the responsible parties cannot be found or held liable, and in such cases, roughly one of four so far \u2014 superfund activities have been covered by taxpayers' funds and form a trust fund established by a federal tax on industries producing petroleum and chemical raw materials \u2014 but congress let the tax expire, the trust fund went bankrupt in 2004, and neither the president nor Congress has moved to restore it \u2014 so taxpayers are now shouldering the entire burden of the program \u2014 as funding dwindles and the remaining cleanup jobs become more expensive, fewer cleanups are being completed \u000a- As of mid-2010, 1,277 Superfund sites remained on the National Priorities List, and only 343 have been cleaned up or otherwise deleted from the list \u000a- the average cleanup has cost over $25 million and has taken nearly 15 years \u000a- many sites are contaminated w/ hazardous chemicals we have no effective way to deal w/ \u000a- in such cases, cleanups simply involve trying to isolate waste from human contact, either by building trenches and clay or concrete barrier around a site or by excavating contaminated material, placing it in industrial strength containers, and shipping it to a hazardous waste disposal facility

It mandated a health-based standard for pesticides used in foods, provided special protections for babies and infants, streamlined the approval of safe pesticides, established incentives for the creation of safer pesticides, and required that pesticide registrations remain current.[1]\u000aOne of the most prominent sections of the act, the specified protections for babies and infants, was the topic of the National Academy of Science's 1993 report, Pesticides in the Diets of Infants & Children. The EPA has cited this report as a catalyst for the creation of the FQPA.[2]

p25453
VWeathering is the breakdown of rock chemically and physically. \u000aChemical weathering (acid rain, chemical reactions O2, CO2 and H2O) \u000aPhysical weathering can be aided by: plant roots, ice (frost wedging like what occurrs in primary succession with lichens) \u000aErosion is the movement of weathered sediments altering the surface of the land. \u000aAgents of erosion are wind and water \u000aRock Cycle- weathering and erosion are important to creation of sedimentary rock \u000aWeathering- breaks down rocks into loose material, aka sediments. \u000aErosion- moves the sediment to a location conducive to creation of sedimentary rocks\u000aMaterial cycling- long term loops of every cycle- Phosphorus, Nitrogen, Carbon, and Sulfur \u000aPhosphorus - major storage is in rocks (see #6 to show environmental impact) \u000aNitrogen, Carbon and Sulfur cycles have important rock components as well. \u000aThe hydrologic cycle is water, driving weathering and erosion processes. \u000aSoil Erosion- Human caused or natural \u000aHuman caused- overcultivation and loss of plant cover i. As seen in Dust Bowl, Grapes of Wrath/Okie style- overcultivated the Midwest plains- loss of fertile topsoil.\u000a\u000aNatural- rain or windiness \u000ai. As seen in Material Cycle \u000a\u000aHarmful Effects of Erosion- \u000aLoss of fertility and water holding capacity- Nutrient rich and porous soil particles blow or wash away first (lightest and smallest) \u000aSediment runoff pollutes water, clogs ditches, channels, lakes, and gills of fishies. \u000aAccelerated erosion can lead to runoff of phosphate/fertilized soil, leading to eutrophication. \u000a Types of water erosion \u000aSheet- water peels off uniform sheets of soil \u000aRill- tiny rivulets of H2O cut vermicelli-sized channels in soil \u000aGully- rivulets join to create bigger channels, eventually creating ditches, or a Grand Canyon.

sVSummary of the Case Study "Mirarr Clan Confront the Jabiluka Uranium Mine"
p27651
VThe remote outback of Australia's Northern Territory is a region of subtropical eucalyptus forests, picturesque cliffs and vast marshes. It is the home of native people (Aboriginal groups, most specifically, the Mirarr Clan), and it also happens to be situated within a region containing a large amount of uranium. Uranium is a key contributor to Australia's economy, and for that reason there has been conflict with developing mines in the area to dig for it. This did not sit well with the Mirarr clan and other aboriginal people and they continued to fight for it because they believed it to be sacred land. They continued to protest until finally in 2004, they finally succeeded when they gained veto power over development. This case exemplifies some of the ways in which values, beliefs, and traditions interact with economic interests to influence the choices all of us make about how to live within our environment.

sV10 Things to Know About: Air Pollution
p29491
VAutomobiles and Industries are the two biggest air polluters \u000aPhotochemical Smog (Brown Air Smog)- mixture of primary and secondary pollutants that form under the sunlight. Mostly ozone in the troposphere \u000aIndustrial Smog (Grey Air Smog)- made mostly from sulfur dioxide, sulfuric acid, which is mainly produced by burning coal and oil. China has the worst build up this pollution. \u000aWhen Nitrogen and Sulfur are released into the atmosphere as pollutants (NOx and SOx...NOT as Nitrogen gas) they can form Sulfuric Acid and Nitric Acid. This falls back to the earth as acid rain. \u000aPoint Source Pollution- direct, easily-traceable source of pollution into the atmosphere (factories) \u000aNon-Point Source Pollution- air pollution that can not be traced to a single spot (deforestation; agricultural runoff; stormwater runoff)\u000a\u000aOzone, Nitrogen Dioxide- Secondary Pollutant \u000aCarbon Monoxide, Sulfur Dioxide- Primary Pollutant\u000a\u000a7. Outdoor Air Pollution\u000a\u000a- Carbon Monoxide- made from fossil fuels burning incompletely, like \u000a\u000a automobiles, primary pollution\u000a\u000a- effects: dizziness, asthma, brain cell damage\u000a\u000a- chemically: CH4 + 3O2 --> 4H2O + 2CO\u000a\u000a- concentration in an urban area: peak is at 6 am, noon, 6 p.m. because of people traveling to work and back\u000a\u000a- Nitrogen Dioxide- fossil fuels burning in cars and industries, turns into acid \u000a\u000a deposition, secondary pollution\u000a\u000a- effects: lung irritation, lung damage, asthma,\u000a\u000a- concentration in an urban area: peak is after 7 am because it takes a few hours to be made since it is a secondary pollutant\u000a\u000a- Sulfur Dioxide- burning fossil fuels, mainly coal and oil, turns into acid deposition, primary pollution\u000a\u000a- effects: asthma, breathing problems\u000a\u000a - chemically: S + O2 --> SO2, acid deposition 2SO2 + O2 --> 2SO3 SO3 +H2O --> H2SO4\u000a\u000a - Suspended Particulate Matter- burning coal, diesel in automobiles\u000a\u000a- effects: nose, throat irritation, lung damage\u000a\u000a- Ozone- reacts with volatile organic compounds (VOC), and nitrogen oxides, which makes photochemical smog, Ozone is in the troposphere, secondary pollution\u000a\u000a- effects: eye, throat, nose irritation, asthma, \u000a\u000a- - chemically: NO2 + UV Light --> NO + O* O* + O2 --> O3, * - not stable\u000a\u000a 8. Indoor Air Pollution\u000a\u000a - Radon- decaying Uranium 222, which is in the ground, gets into house by cracks, \u000a\u000a hollow cement blocks, water supply\u000a\u000a- effects: lung cancer\u000a\u000a - Asbestos- pipe insulation, building materials, like floor tiles\u000a\u000a- effects: lung cancer, lung disease\u000a\u000a - Carbon Monoxide- faulty furnaces, unvented gas stoves, wood stoves, kerosene \u000a\u000a heater\u000a\u000a- effects: headaches, drowsiness, irregular heartbeats\u000a\u000a - Nitrogen Oxides- unvented gas stoves, kerosene heater, wood stoves\u000a\u000a- effects: irritated lungs, colds, headaches\u000a\u000a9. temperature inversion- layer of warm air on top of layer of cold air, pollutants \u000a\u000acannot rise above cold air causing pollution to build up. The worst place to be is with mountains on three sides, and wind blowing from the sea on the last side. This traps the pollution in the city.\u000a\u000a 10. two factors that dilute the pollutants in the atmosphere\u000a\u000a- wind speed- a higher wind speed pushes air pollution over a greater distance\u000a\u000a- mixing height- warm air over cold air does not allow air pollution to escape because cold air is denser. In order for air pollution to be diluted, the warm air over cold air mass should be fairly high in the troposphere.

sV10 things to Know about Ozone Depletion
p29975
VOzone Depletion: \u000aHEALTHY OZONE LAYER\u000a1.) Ozone is a compound that occurs naturally in the stratosphere and protects life on earth from UV radiation. \u000a2.) Process between oxygen and ozone: (O2 + UV à 2O), (O + O2 à O3), (O3 + UV à O2 + O)\u000a\u000a \u000a\u000aWHAT HUMANS HAVE DONE\u000a3.) CFCs (highly inert chemicals used as coolants, propellant, cleaners, and gas for foaming of Styrofoam.) \u000a4.) Polar Stratospheric Clouds (PSCs) (form during the winter)\u2014provide surface for reactions that release chlorine.\u000a5.) Process about how oxygen depletes:(CFCs + PSCs à Cl2 + UV à 2Cl), Cl + O3 à ClO + O2), (ClO + O à O2 + Cl) Chlorine is a CATALYST!! Oh no!\u000a6.) More UV radiation getting through causing increased skin and eye damage as well as mutations that cause cancer.\u000a7.) Environmental Damage (global warming, destruction of ocean habitats, crop damage, etc.)\u000a8.) Ozone hole forms in the stratosphere and is most prominent in the Artic and Antarctic in the spring \u000a9.) Polar Vortex- forms when air is circulating around the poles and traps cold air and makes the ground and air colder. \u000a10.) Depletion has increased in the past twenty years because of increased use of CFCs. CFCs were discovered to be harmful in 1974. It takes 20 years for CFC's to reach the stratosphere.

p31162
V- even if our clean coal technologies were able to remove every last chemical contaminant from power plant emissions, coal combustion would still pump huge amounts of carbon dioxide into the air, intensifying the GH effect and worsening global climate change \u2014 current efforts are focused on carbon capture and carbon storage or sequestration \u2014 this approach consist of capturing carbon dioxide emissions, converting the gas to a liquid form, and then sequestering it in the ocean or underground in a geologically stable rock formation \u000a- carbon capture and storage is now being attempted at a variety of new and retrofitted facilities, most of which also control other emissions from coal \u000a- currently the U.S. Department of Energy is teaming up w/ nine domestic and foreign energy companies to build a prototype of a near-zone-emissions coal-fired power plant \u2014 FutureGen project aims to design, construct, and operate a power plant that burns coal using gasification and combined cycle generation, produces electricity and hydrogen, and captures its carbon dioxide emissions and sequesters the carbon dioxide underground \u000a- energy experts are not ready to rely on carbon capture and storage quite yet \u2014 at this point the technology is too unproven to be the central focus of clean energy strategy \u2014 we do not know whether we can ensure that carbon dioxide will stay underground once injected there, and we do not know whether these attempts might trigger earthquakes \u2014 injection could cause contamination of underground supplies, and injecting carbon dioxide into the ocean would acidify its waters \u2014 many renewable every advocates fear that CCS approach takes the burned off emitters and prolongs our dependence on fossil fuels rather than facility a shift to renewables

sVSoil Conservation Act of 1935
p31994
VThe U.S. Soil Conservation Act of 1935 established the Soil Conservation Service. This agency deals with soil erosion problems. In its early years, the Soil Conservation Service carried out numerous soil surveys of various sections of the United States. The agency also showed insight into many developing conservational problems, including soil salinity control. It also published, and continues to do so, maps of soil erosion and related problems. It has continued to practice all these activities in the years since, adding to its repertoire by providing computer databases for scientific research, such as pesticides. Although the United States still must deal with soil erosion issues, no doubt these would have been much more consequential without the Soil Conservation Act and Service.

Another aspect of this problem can be seen when wealthier, politically active, and majority white communities get a disproportionately greater share of improvements of infrastructure, like new roads, public buildings, and water sewer projects.\u000a- Justice between the industrialized and developing countries becomes an issue when it leaves people without land, without adequate food, and in poor health.This poverty is often brought about when more wealthy elites maintain political power and corrupt corporations.

sVSanitary landfills
p32520
V- waste is buried in the ground or piled up in large, carefully engineered mounds \u000a- are designed to prevent waste from contaminating the environment and treating public health \u000a- most municipal landfills in the U.S are regulated locally or by the states, but they myst meet national standards set by the EPA, under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), enacted in 1976 and amended in 1984 \u000a- in sanitary landfill, waste is partially decomposed by bacteria and compresses under its own weight to take up less space; soil is layered along w/ the waste to speed decomposition, reduce odor, and lessen infestation by pests; some infiltration of rainwater into the landfill is good, b/c it encourages biodegradation by aerobic and anaerobic bacteria\u000a- to protect against environmental contamination, U.S. regulations require that landfills be located away from wetlands and earthquake-prone faults and be at least 6 meters above the water table \u000a- the bottoms and sides of sanitary landfills must be lined w/ heavy-duty plastic and 60-120 cm of impermeable clay to help prevent contaminants from seeping into aquifers\u000a- sanitary landfills have systems of pipes, collection ponds, and treatment facilities to collect and treat leachate, liquid that results when substances from the trash dissolve in water as rainwater percolates downward \u000a- landfill manager are required to maintain leachate collection systems for 30 years after a landfill has closed \u000a- regulations require that area groundwater be monitored regularly for contamination \u000a- once a landfill is closed, it is capped w/ an engineered cover that must be maintained \u000a- this cap consisted of a hydraulic barrier of plastic, which prevents water from seeping down and gas from seeping up; a gravel layer above the hydraulic barrier, which drains water, lessening pressure on the hydraulic barrier; a soil barrier which stores water and protected the hydraulic layer from weather extremes; and a topsoil layer which encourages plant growth to minimize erosion \u000a- the Fresh Kills Landfill predated most of the EPA guidelines \u2014 it caused some environmental contamination \u2014 however, engineers have retrofitted the landfill w/ clay liners and a sophisticated leachate collection system \u2014 three of the sic mounds have been capped w/ a "final cover", and the remaining mounds will soon be capped

V- emissions trading programs generally allow participants to buy carbon offsets, voluntary payments intended to enable another entity to rescue emissions that one is unable to reduce oneself \u2014 the payment just offsets one's own emissions \u000a- carbon offsets have fast become popular among utilities businesses, universities, governments, & individuals trying to achieve carbon-neutrality, a state in which no net carbon is emitted \u2014 for busy people w/ enough wealth, offsets represent a simple & convenient way to reduce one's emissions w/o investing in efforts to change one's habits \u000a- in principle, carbon offsets seem a great idea, but w/o rigorous oversight to make sure that the offset money actually accomplishes what it is intended for, carbon offset risk being little more than a way for wealthy consumers to assuage a quality conscience \u2014 offsets are effective only if they find emissions reductions that would not occur otherwise \u2014 & b/c trees can sock up only so much carbon dioxide, at some point our ability to reduce emissions by funding reforestation could each its limit \u2014 efforts to create a transparent & enforceable system for verifying the effectiveness of offsets are ongoing \u2014 if these offsets succeed, then carbon offsets could become an important means of mitigating climate change

The OPA requires oil storage facilities and vessels to submit to the Federal government plans detailing how they will respond to large discharges. EPA has published regulations for aboveground storage facilities; the Coast Guard has done so for oil tankers. The OPA also requires the development of Area Contingency Plans to prepare and plan for oil spill response on a regional scale.

It is also very flexible because it can be used at any time in the process of the growth of the crop. Lastly it stays in the environment for several months after application here for preventing weed seeds from germinating. Unfortunately the drawbacks are equally as bad. For example an estimated 600,000 kg of the herbicide atrazine has been found in the Great Lakes. Other drawbacks include obviously the contamination of the waterways showing up in many of the waterways in the United States quite a few above levels Shonen to harm animals and plants.

sVSummary of the "Lesson of Easter Island"
p34460
VEaster Island is located in the Pacific Ocean 1,395 miles from the next nearest inhabited island. When archeologists landed there and discovered a population of around 2,000 people and hundreds of huge stone statues, they were curious as to how these 99-ton rocks could have been moved over 6 miles from the shoreline with no rope, trees or wheels to do so. After doing some research, they determined that the island once had an abundance of trees, but that they were all depleted by the people that lived there. This shows the affect that population growth can have on the environment that it lives in. The researchers guessed that the population of people that lived there before was once between 6,000 and 30,000 people, and had since decreased. This case also proves that this exact scenario could happen to our environment if we don't take care of it properly.

p36384
VThe clean water act is probably the United States most successful and popular environmental legislation. It was passed in 1972 and aimed to restore in maintain the chemical physical and biological integrity of the nations waters. It is the most successful environmental legislation because of the success it had with water problems. For example, point source solutions required discharge permits and BPT best practicable control technology helping to regulate and reduce point source solution. It also set national goals of best available, economically achievable technology (BAT), for toxic substances and zero discharge for 126 priority toxic pollutants. These water regulations have had a positive effect on water quality. Surface- water quality in the United States has significantly improve on avg over past quarter century. The most imp result has been an investment of 54 billion in federal funds and more than 128 billion in state and local funds for municipal sewage treatment facilities. Even with these successes the legislation still needs to work on things. Like agricultural runoff is largest source of surface water degradation but regulation remains a difficult problem. Change the focus on removing specific pollutants from effluents To more attention to changing industrial processes so toxic substances won't be produced in the first place. Stricter enforcement of existing regulations, mandatory minimum penalties for violations, more effective community right to know provisions and increased powers for citizens lawsuits against polluters

sVTen Things to Know About Toxicology:
p36626
VAny substance can be toxic, but toxicity depends on the dose. \u000aYou can be exposed to a toxicant in three ways: ingestion, inhalation, dermal (skin) exposure. \u000aFate is the ultimate resting location of a toxicant, and transport is the process by which it arrives there. \u000aHydrophilic toxicants dissolve in water, and hydrophobic toxicants dissolve in fats and do not tend to dissolve in water. \u000aA cell responds to a toxicant by: altering permeability, destroying the toxicant, increasing repair, increasing production of toxicant's target, altering toxicant receptor. \u000aTo relate to a cancer, a cell can control/alter: differentiation or development, apoptosis, its response to the environment. \u000aDNA can be damaged by: mutagens (anything that can alter DNA production), carcinogens (cancer causing mutagens), sunlight (UV damage), oxidation. \u000aEndocrine disruptors are chemicals that when absorbed into the body blocks, or mimics, hormones, thus changing the body's functions; they are found in household chemicals and chemicals used in agriculture. \u000aCHRONIC MEASURES OF TOXICITY: LOEC is the lowest dose for which an effect can be seen. NOEC is the greatest dose for which no effect is observed. \u000aRisk = Exposure * Harm

sVFarm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002
p37214
Vthe latest version of the "farm bill," which has been amended and renamed every 5 years or so since the 1930's)\u000aalso known as the 2002 Farm Bill, includes ten titles, addressing a great variety of issues related to agriculture, ecology, energy, trade, and nutrition.\u000aThe act directs approximately 16.5 billion dollars of funding toward agricultural subsidies each year.[1] These subsidies have a dramatic effect on the production of grains, oilseeds, and upland cotton. The specialized nature of the farm bill, as well as the size and timing of the bill, made its passage highly contentious.\u000aDebated in the U.S. House of Representatives during the immediate aftermath of the September 11th attacks in 2001, the bill drew criticism from the White House and was nearly amended. The amendment, which failed by a close margin, was proposed by Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI) and would have shifted money away from grain subsidies to conservation measures. Public debate over the farm bill continued, and the Senate proposed sweeping amendments to the bill, leading to a series of meetings from February through April. As a result, the current farm bill was not passed until May 2002, after the 1996 farm bill had already expired.

sVFast cooling igneous rocks
p37218
VExtrusive igneous rocks come from lava. Lava, at the surface, is exposed to air and water which causes the molten rock to cool rapidly. Solidifying rocks at the surface cool too quickly for large crystals to form. Molecules in the lava do not have time to arrange themselves to form large crystals. Extrusive rocks have crystals that are too small to see without magnification. A common example of an extrusive igneous rock is basalt.

p37676
V- dogged by concerns over waste disposal, safety, and expensive cost overruns, nuclear power's growth has slowed \u000a- Public anxiety in the wake of Chernobyl made utilities less willing to invest in new plants \u2014 so did the enormous expense of building, maintaining, operations, and ensuring the safety of nuclear facilities \u000a- almost every nuclear plant has turned out to be far more expensive than expected b/c of problems that were underestimated, such as corrosion in coolant pipes \u000a- the plants that have been shut down have served on average less than half their expected lifetimes \u2014 shutting down, or decommissioning, a plant can sometimes be more expensive than the original construction \u000a- as a result of these economic issues, electricity from nuclear power today remains more expensive than electricity from coal and other sources \u000a- governments are still subsidizing nuclear power to keep electricity cots to ratepayers down, but man private investors lost interest long ago \u2014 nonetheless, nuclear power remains one of the few currently viable alternatives to fossil fuels w/ which we can generate large amounts of electricity in short order \u2014 for a nation wishing to cut its carbon emissions quickly and substantially, nuclear power is in many respects the leading opinion \u000a- many experts predict nuclear power will decline b/c 3/4 of Western Europe's plants will be retired by 2030 \u2014 however, increased concern over climate change and carbon emissions has recently led several European nations that had planned to phased out nuclear power to reverse their decisions, just as Sweden did \u000a- Expanding U.S. nuclear capacity would decrease reliance on coal for electricity and would allow the nation to cut its GHG emissions that contribute to climate change \u2014 proponents of expanding nuclear power stress that engineers are planning a new generation of reactors designed to be safer and less expensive \u000a- w/ slow growth expected for nuclear power, fossil fuels in limited supply, an oil production peak looming, and climate change worsening, where will our growing human population turn for clean and sustainable energy?

p38100
V- strip-mining destroys large swaths of habitat and causes extensive soil erosion \u2014 cause chemical runoff deep into waterways through the process of acid drainage: occurs when sulfide minerals in newly exposed rock surfaces react w/ oxygen and rainwater produce sulfuric acid \u2014 as sulfuric acid runs off, it leaches metals from the rocks, many of which are toxic to organisms\u000a- acid drainage is a natural phenomenon, but ming greatly accelerates the rate at which it occurs by exposing many new rock surfaces at once \u000a- regulations in the U.S. require mining, but complete restoration is impossible, and ecological modifications are severe and long-lasting \u2014 most other nations exercise less oversight \u000a- mountaintop removal has even greater impacts than conventional strip mining \u2014 when countless tons of rock and soil are removed from the top of a mountain, material slides downhill, where immense areas of habitat can be degraded or destroyed and creek beds can be clogged and polluted \u000a- the costs of alleviating all these environmental impacts \u2014 to say nothing of the health impacts on miners and on nearby residents \u2014 are high, and the public eventually pays them in an inefficient manner \u2014 the reason is that the costs are generally not internalized in the market prices of fossil fuels \u2014 instead, we all pay these external costs through medical expenses, costs of environmental cleanup, and impacts on our quality of life \u2014 the prices we pay at the gas pump or on our monthly utility bill do no even cover the financial costs of fossil fuel production \u2014 fossil fuel prices have been kept inexpensive as a result of government subsidies to extraction companies \u2014 the profitable and well-established fossil fuel industries still receive fear more financial support from taxpayers than do the young and struggling renewable energy sources \u2014 we all pay extra for our fossil fuel energy though a portion of our tax dollars, generally w/o even realizing it

sVIs bioenergy carbon-neutral?
p39030
V- energy from biomass is carbon-neutral, releasing no net carbon into the atmosphere \u000a- although burning biomass its plenty of carbon, this is balance by the fact that photosynthesis had pulled this amount of carbon from the atmosphere to create the biomass just years, months, or weeks before \u2014 when we replace fossil fuels w/ bioenergy, we reduce net carbon flux to the atmosphere, helping to mitigate global climate change \u000a- in practice things are not so simple \u2014 burning biomass for energy is not carbon-neutral if natural forests are destroyed in order to plant bioenergy crops \u000a- forests sequester more carbon than do croplands, so deforesting land to plant crops will increase carbon flux to the atmosphere \u2014 bioenergy use is not carbon-neutral if we need to input fossil-fuel energy to produce the biomass \u000a- international climate change policy so far has failed to encourage sustainable bioenergy approaches \u2014 the kyoto protocol requires nations to submit data on emissions from energy use and from change in land use, but only the emissions from energy use are "counted" toward judging how well nations are controlling their emissions under the treaty \u2014 creates loopholes the result in unintended, perverse incentives

V- Protecting natural areas before they become degraded is the best way to safeguard biodiversity and ecological systems \u2014 however, in some cases we can restore degraded natural systems to some semblance of their former condition, through the practice of ecological restoration\u000a- informed by the science of restoration ecology, efforts to restore damaged ecosystems aim not just to bring back populations of animals and plants, but to reestablish the processes \u2014 the cycling of matter and the flow of energy \u2014 that make an ecosystem function \u2014 by restoring complex natural system \u000a- Vast marshes of southern Iraq -- for several thousands years, tens of thousands of people lived sustainable among the wetlands and channels of this region in the floodplain of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, thriving on its plentiful fish and shellfish -- these wetlands began to be drained for oil exploration in the 1970s and during the Iran-Iraq War in 1980s -- Saddam viewed the Shiite people living in the marshes to be disloyal and worried that the marshes offered refuge to Shiite rebels who sought his overthrow -- In 1990s, Saddam ordered a huge system of dikes and canals built to drain the marshes, devastating the wetlands and the communities of people living there -- many nations have joined together to restore the marshes

p42251
V- all forms of geothermal energy greatly reduce emissions relative to fossil fuel combustion \u000a- although geothermal heated water can release dissolved gases, these are generally in small quantities, and facilities using the latests filtering technologies produce even fewer emissions\u000a- on the negative side, geothermal sources may not always be truly sustainable \u2014 geothermal energy is renewable in principle, but the power plants we build to capture this energy may not all be able to operate indefinitely\u000a- if a geothermal plant uses heated water more quickly than groundwater is recharged, the plant will eventually run out of water \u000a- a second reason geothermal energy may not always be renewable is that patterns of geothermal activity in Earth's crust shifts naturally over time \u2014 means that an area that produces hot groundwater now may not always do so \u000a- in addition, the water of many hot springs is laced w/ salts and minerals that corrode equipment and pollute the air \u2014 may shorten the lifetime of plants, increase maintenance costs, and add to pollution \u000a- the greatest limitation go geothermal electric power is that is limited to regions where we can tap the energy from naturally heated groundwater

Sanitary landfills- The compaction of waste into a lined pit. (Covered with earth and impermeable cover.)\u000a\u000a4. Hazardous Waste: Discarded solid of liquid material that: a) catches fire easily, b) is reactive and unstable (chance of explosion), c) Can corrode metal containers, and d) contains a great enough level of any chemical on a list of thirty nine chemicals that the EPA has determined are toxic.\u000a\u000a5. RECYCLE, REUSE, AND REDUCE!!! (It's healthy!)\u000a\u000a6. Methane is produced in landfills. (And that's bad... if it catches on fire. It is ALSO A POTENT GREENHOUSE GAS!!!!!)\u000a\u000a7. Detoxification and Phytoremediation: Biological treatment of hazardous waste.\u000a\u000a8. Incineration: Pros: Reduces volume, produces energy, and it does not create much water Pollution. Cons: Costs a lot, creates air pollution, and produces toxic byproducts. \u000a\u000a9. Economics play a large role in how waste is disposed. Weighing the cost to the possible detrimental effect on the environment, and comparing it's\u000a\u000aeffectiveness. This is why the best methods of disposal aren't always used.\u000a\u000a10. Leachate: Solution of stuff in a landfill that binds/mixes with water. (It's bad stuff; it can pollute things.)

sVExplain the process of cultural eutrophication. Differentiate between the positive and negative effects of eutrophication.
p44021
VCultural eutrophication is the increase in biological productivity and ecosystem succession caused by human activities. For example, if fertilizer runoff, nutrient enrichment sewage, or maybe even decomposing leaves in the street gutters happen to enter the water, these substances would help increase biological productivity. Eutrophication can have positive effects because it could be beneficial. With eutrophication, Fish and other desirable species may grow faster, providing a welcome food source. Unfortunately, there happens to be a fair amount of negative effects. An increase of phosphorus and nitrogen levels can stimulate a bountiful growth of algae or other thick aquatic plants. Another affect includes the increase of bacterial populations due to larger amounts of organic material.The water can become cloudy along with unpleasant tastes and odors. The most astonishing negative effect is the possibility that plants and algae would die and decomposers would deplete oxygen in the water resulting in the collapse of the aquatic ecosystem.

Vthe first part of the process takes place during the day in the presence of sunlight; if there is an abundance of NOx but very few VOCs, O3 forms; a few hours later, when sunlight intensity decreases, NO is still present in the atmosphere and the O3 recombines with NO, reforming into O2 + NO2; when petrochemicals or VOCs from human activity are absent or limited, the cycle of O3 formation and destruction generally takes place on a daily basis with relatively small amounts of photochemical smog formations, but when VOCs are present, they combine with NO; this means the NO is not available to break down O3 by recombining with it and a larger amount of O3 accumulates; atmospheric temperatures (usually higher temperatures) and location (most likely urban, but may occur elsewhere) are contributing factors

p45461
VThe Wilderness Act of 1964 (Pub.L. 88-577) was written by Howard Zahniser of The Wilderness Society. It created the legal definition of wilderness in the United States, and protected some 9 million acres (36,000 km2) of federal land. The result of a long effort to protect federal wilderness and to create a formal mechanism for designating wilderness, the Wilderness Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on September 3, 1964 after over sixty drafts and eight years of work.\u000aThe Wilderness Act is well known for its succinct and poetic definition of wilderness:\u000a"A wilderness, in contrast with those areas where man and his own works dominate the landscape, is hereby recognized as an area where the earth and community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain."\u000aWhen Congress passed and President Lyndon Johnson signed the Wilderness Act on September 3, 1964, it created the National Wilderness Preservation System. The initial statutory wilderness areas, designated in the Act, comprised 9.1 million acres\u000a(37,000 km2) of national forest wilderness areas in the United States of America previously protected by administrative orders. The current amount of areas designated by the NWPS as wilderness totals 107.5 million acres of wilderness in 44 states and Puerto Rico, totaling 4.82% of the United States.

V- most of our hydroelectric power comes from impounding water in reservoirs behind concrete fans that block the flow of river and then letting that water pass through the dam \u2014 b/c immense amounts of water are stored behind dams, this called the storage technique \u000a- as reservoir water passes through a damn, it turns the blades of turbines, which cause a generator to generate electricity \u2014 electricity generated in the powerhouse of a damn is transmitted to the electric grid by transmission lines, and the water is allowed to flow into the riverbed below the damn to continue downriver \u2014 the amount of power generated depends on the distance the water falls and the volume of water released \u2014 by storing water in reservoirs, dam operator can ensure a steady and predictable supply of electricity at all times, even during period of naturally low river flow\u000a- Run-of-River approach, which generates electricity w/o greatly disrupting the flow of river water \u2014 sacrifices the reliability of water flow across seasons that the storage approach guarantees, but its minimizes many of the impacts of large dams \u2014 the approach can use several methods, of of which is to divert a portion of river's flow through a pipe or channel, passing it through a powerhouse and then returning it to the river \u2014 can be done w/ or w/o a small reservoir that pools water temporarily, and the pipe or channel can be run along the surface or underground \u2014 another method is to flow river water over a damn small enough to impede fish passage, siphoning off water to turn turbines, and then returning the water to the river

Growth (ZPG) \u000a \u000a\u000aTFR stands for total fertility rate which refers to the amount children a women might have throughout her life. This is important because when the TFR goes down, the population will most likely go down. \u000a \u000a\u000aLess developed countries (LDC) i.e. Sudan, Sub-Saharan Africa, some parts of India and More developed countries (MDC) i.e. Europe, and US. \u000a \u000a\u000aThe transitional phase is when the death rate (concentration of deaths in children and newborns) has dropped but the birth rate has not yet dropped. You see this in places like Kenya. \u000a \u000a\u000aTrend by youth not to get married and have families, and strain on social services because a large population is about to reach or has reached retirement age. This is also due to the education and empowered of women. This is happening in places like Japan. \u000a \u000a\u000aPopulation booms occur not because of birth rates increasing but because of death rates dropping. The same amounts of children are being born, but not as many of them are dying. \u000a \u000a\u000aDeveloping countries are held in place because of the lack of health care and education given to families, specifically women, so that they are trapped in a demographic transition (they are having the same amount of children and less are dieing). \u000a \u000a\u000aReplacement level fertility (RLF). 2.1 for a MDC and 2.5 for LDC. This is the amount of children a woman must have to keep the population stable. \u000a \u000a\u000aThe US is unique because it has been below RLF for several years but has maintained a growing population due to the acceptance of immigrants into the United States.

sVEthanol may not be our most sustainable energy choice
p46405
V- The enthusiasm for corn-based ethanol shown by U.S. policymakers is not widely shared by environmental scientists\u000a- one reason is that growing corn to produce ethanol exerts considerable impacts on ecosystems, including pesticide use, fertilizer use, fresh water depletion, and other consequence of monocultural industrialized agriculture \u000a- corn ethanol crops take up precious land that might otherwise be left in its natural condition or developed for other purposes \u2014 the nation would need to expand its already immense corn acreage by five times, w/ no loss of productivity \u000a- ethanol already competes w/ food production and drives up food prices \u000a- as farmers shifted more corn crops to ethanol in '06-'08, corn supplies for food dropped, and international cron prices skyrocketed, making it difficult for the poor to afford food \u2014 protests and riots ensued in many nations \u000a- growing corn for ethanol requires substantial inputs of energy \u2014 we currently operate farm equipment using oil, and farmers apply petroleum-based pesticides and fertilizers to increase yields \u2014 oil is used in refineries to heat water so that we can distill ethanol \u2014 thus, simply shifting from gasoline to corn ethanol for our transportation needs would not eliminate our reliance on fossil fuels \u000a- corn ethanol yields only a modest amount of energy relative to the energy that needs to be input \u000a- the EROI ratio for corn-based ethanol is variable and controversial, but recent estimates place it around 1:5:1 \u2014 this means that to gain 1.5 units of energy from ethanol, we need to expend 1 unit of energy

Helps the States develop and carry out their forest conservation plans. It encourages and supports acquisition of conservation easements, legally binding agreements transferring a negotiated set of property rights from one party to another, without removing the property from private ownership. Most conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable forestry practices, and protect other values.

p47665
V- for fission to begin in a nuclear reactor, the neutrons bombarding uranium are slowed down w/ a substance called a moderator, most often water or graphite \u000a- as fission proceeds, it becomes necessary to soak up the excess neutrons produced when uranium nuclei divide, so that on average only a single neutron from each nucleus foes on to split another nucleus \u2014 for this purpose, control rods, made of a metallic allow that absorbs neutrons, are placed into the reactor among the water-bathed fuel rods \u2014 engineers move these control rods into and out of the water to maintain the fission reaction at the desire rate \u000a- all this takes place within the reactor core and is the first step in the electricity-generating process of a nuclear power plant \u000a- the reactor core is housed within a reactor vessel, and the vessel, stem generator, and associated plumbing are often protected within a containment building \u000a- containment buildings are constructed to prevent leaks of radioactivity due to accidents or natural catastrophes such s earthquakes \u2014 not all nations require containment buildings, which points out the key role that government regulation plays in protecting public safety

sVWhat is wrong with sprawl
p47993
V1. sprawl constrains people to use cars. Because they are far away from the stuff they need they need their own car. They also spend more time in their car.\u000a2. more cars driving longer means more pollution. Motor oil and salt runoff from roads increases water pollution.\u000a(storm drains carry water off the streets to prevent hydroplaning of cars)\u000a3. All that time in the car means less exercise. With the large number of people commuting this may have contributed to the difference of 6 lbs in weight between cities that have the highest number commuters with cities where commuting is less common. This can affect blood pressure which was different in the two groups being higher for the high commute cities.\u000a4. land use- forest, and agricultural lands are converted to streets and yards with houses.2.5 million acres are converted each year. 60% are agricultural lands and 40% are forests.\u000a5. economics- money that could be used to improve cities is used to build new roads,and new school etc. Using more resources and costing far more money that doing schools and repairing old roads in the cities.

p48703
VPoint sources are specific locations of highly concentrated pollution discharge. Examples of Point sources include factories, power plants, sewage treatment plants, oil wells, underground coal mines, and drainpipes. On the other hand, nonpoint sources are scattered, diffuse sources of pollutants, such as runoff from farm fields, golf courses, construction sites, and feedlots. Through the Clean Water Act of 1972, point sources did not only require discharge permits, but a BPT which stands for Best Practicable Control Technology. BPT is the best technology for pollution control available at a reasonable cost and operable under normal conditions. The requirement of a permit and BPT has helped reduce point source pollution.

p48833
VFour main resources, Land (Natural Resources), Labor (Human Resources), Capital (Manufactured Resources), Cash (Financial Resources). \u000aGross National Product (GNP) - Amount of income produced by all a countries businesses. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - Amount of income produced by all businesses within a country. These do not show how the environment in a country is. \u000aFull cost accounting- companies or consumers pay for the damage to the environment during production. \u000aEconomics can influence decisions such as the burn off and waste of excess natural gas that is not economically beneficial for a company to transport. \u000aInternality- Cost paid by seller and buyer. Externality- Cost paid by society and the environment. \u000aTax deductions and subsidies give companies economic incentives to reduce pollution. \u000aCleaning up all pollution is not economical so people are not willing to do it to help the environment if they feel they are putting in more then they are getting out. \u000aPoverty can lead to environmental issues because they use resources unsustainably and are willing to cause damage to the environment if it helps them survive. \u000aPoverty leads to increased birth rates which results in the use of more resources by more people. \u000aSustainability is the ability for a system either economic or environmental to sustain itself for a certain period of time.

V- changes in earth's physical systems often have direct consequences for living things \u2014 organisms adapted to their environments, so they are affected when the environments are altered \u2014 as global warming proceeds, it is modifying all manner of biological phenomena that are regulated by temperature \u2014 altering shifts can create mismatches in seasonal timing \u000a- biologists also record spatial shifts in the ranges of organisms, w/ plants & animals moving towards the piles or upward in elevation as temperatures warm \u2014 as these trends continue, some organisms will not be able to cope, & the IPCC estimates that as many as 20-30% of all plant & animal species could be threatened w/ extinction \u000a- trees many not be able to shift their distributions fast enough \u2014 rare species may be forced out of preserves into developed areas, undercutting the effectiveness of refuges as tools for conservation \u2014 animal & plants adapted to montane environments may be forced uphill until there is nowhere left to go \u000a- effects on plant communities comprise an important component of climate change, b/c by drawing carbon dioxide for photosynthesis, plants air as reservoirs for carbon \u2014 if higher carbon dioxide concentrations enhance vegetative growth, this could hep mitigate carbon emissions in a process of negative feedback \u2014 however, if climate change decreases plant growth, then positive feedback could increase carbon flux to the atmosphere \u000a- Free-Air Carbon Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiments are revealing complex answers, showing that extra carbon dioxide can bring both positive & negative results for plant growth \u000a- in regions where precipitation & stream flow increase, erosion & flooding will pollute & alter aquatic systems \u2014 in regions where precipitation decreases, lakes, ponds, wetlands, & streams will shrink, affecting aquatic organisms, as well as human health & well-being \u2014 will diminish the ecosystems goods & services we receive from nature & that our societies depend on, from food to clean air to drinking water

sVHow is acid precipitation produced? What are its effects? And how is it remediated?
p49619
VAcid precipitation is produced when you gaseous sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxygen are released into the atmosphere. These gases react with oxygen and water in the atmosphere to form sulfuric and nitric acids and sulfate and nitrate salts. Natural balance like volcanic irruption's force fires Hot Springs and natural geysers can produce these gases but human activity also contributes. Coal burning and industrial plants contribute to sulfur dioxide and cool burning in motor vehicles contribute to nitrogen oxide. Acid precipitation affects explants human made structures surface water aquatic species and human health. It damages the leads in Berks of trees which impairs the plants ability to photosynthesize. It leaches calcium and magnesium from the soil depriving already wakened trees of essential minerals. Many statues and buildings are made of calcium carbonate in the form of marble or limestone which both react with acid precipitation to form calcium sulfate carbon dioxide and water. These buildings and sculptures affected by acid precipitation turn black and must be cleaned in order to retain their intend appearance they can also simply dissolve. It also acidifies surface water resulting in harm to aquatic species because it changes the pH which can cause changes to the aquatic species. It can be remediated through neutralization. Surface waters and souls can neutralize acid precip. In surface water hydrogen carbonates carbonates and hydroxides contribut to the alkalinity and in soil soil derived from limestone have a high buffering capacity. This helps remediate the acid rain.

VThe Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) was established to protect the quality of drinking water in the U.S. This law focuses on all waters actually or potentially designed for drinking use, whether from above ground or underground sources.\u000aThe Act authorizes EPA to establish minimum standards to protect tap water and requires all owners or operators of public water systems to comply with these primary (health-related) standards. The 1996 amendments to SDWA require that EPA consider a detailed risk and cost assessment, and best available peer-reviewed science, when developing these standards. State governments, which can be approved to implement these rules for EPA, also encourage attainment of secondary standards (nuisance- related). Under the Act, EPA also establishes minimum standards for state programs to protect underground sources of drinking water from
