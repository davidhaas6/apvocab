sVFemale Reproduction and Pathway
p7
VThe female reproductive system has two oval shaped ovaries located in the pelvis above the uterus. They are the major female sex organs and produce ova or eggs. Each ovary contains over thousands of ova. The ovum is a tiny female sex cell that unites with a male sperm to form a fertilized egg. There are two fallopian tubes that are connected and located on each side of the uterus. Each tube is 1 to 1-1/2 inches long and about as wide as spaghetti. On each end of the fallopian tubes is a fringe like funnel that wraps around much of the ovary and when ovulation occurs, it scoops up the egg or ovum that has been released. Tiny hairs in the tube help push the egg or ovum down to the uterus. The uterus is or womb is a sac shaped like an upside down pear with a thick lining and pelvis area in which a fertilized egg or zygote comes and grows into a fetus.

VThe process of turning genes on or off. Gene regulation ensures that appropriate genes are expressed at the proper times (such as early development). Gene regulation can also help an organism respond to its environment. It occurs in the nucleus prior to transcription. Some proteins are always necessary for an organism's survival and are continuously produced. Expression of the gene is always occurring (RNA/DNA polymerase, glycoproteins). Other proteins need to be produced at certain times and in certain amounts. Expression of the gene is turned on or off. All cells carry the same genetic information, but each type of cell expresses only a fraction of its genes (cellular differentiation).

p3669
V1. Surface area to volume ration (S/V): Basically when the surface area is much larger than the volume, then the S/V ratio would be large. This means that (since the surface area is large) the cell can exchange a lot of material with the outside (like taking in O2 or releasing waste), at a rate that'' satisfy the volume of the cell. However, if the volume of the cell is too large compared to the surface area, not much material can be exchanged to service the large volume of the cell. Therefore, cell growth stops or cell division beings.\u000a\u000a2. Genome to volume ratio (G/V): Our genetic material is what creates important molecules for out bodies (like enzymes and proteins). A larger genome means more of these materials. If the G/V ratio is large, then there is a lot of genetic material, thus can produce a lot of molecules to satisfy the volume of the cell. However, if G/V ratio is small, then the volume is way too large that the genetic material cannot satisfy the size of the cell. Therefore, cell division starts or cell growth stops.

p3854
sVExplain how the primary structure of a protein is determined.
p3855
VThe primary structure refers to amino acid sequence of the polypeptide chain. The primary structure is held together by covalent or peptide bonds, which are made during the process of protein biosynthesis or translation. The two ends of the polypeptide chain are referred to as the carboxyl terminus (C-terminus) and the amino terminus (N-terminus) based on the nature of the free group on each extremity. Counting of residues always starts at the N-terminal end (NH2-group), which is the end where the amino group is not involved in a peptide bond. The primary structure of a protein is determined by the gene corresponding to the protein. A specific sequence of nucleotides in DNA is transcribed into mRNA, which is read by the ribosome in a process called translation. The sequence of a protein is unique to that protein, and defines the structure and function of the protein.

VPhotosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, normally from the Sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities (energy transformation). \u000a\u000aThe light-independent reactions of photosynthesis are chemical reactions that convert carbon dioxide and other compounds into glucose. These reactions occur in the stroma, the fluid-filled area of a chloroplast outside of the thylakoid membranes. These reactions take the products (ATP and NADPH) of light-dependent reactions and perform further chemical processes on them.\u000a\u000aIn photosynthesis, the light-dependent reactions take place on the thylakoid membranes. The inside of the thylakoid membrane is called the lumen, and outside the thylakoid membrane is the stroma, where the light-independent reactions take place. The thylakoid membrane contains some integral membrane protein complexes that catalyze the light reactions.

V1. No mutations - the gene pool is modified if mutations alter alleles or if entire genes are deleted or duplicated.\u000a2. Random mating - if individuals mate preferentially within a subset of the population, such as their close relatives (inbreeding) random mixing of gametes does not occur, and genotype frequencies change.\u000a3. No natural selection - differences in the survival and reproductive success of individuals carrying different genotypes can alter allele frequencies.\u000a4. Extremely large population size - the smaller the population the more likely itis that allele frequencies will fluctuate by chance from one generation to the next ( process is called genetic drift).\u000a5.

p4803
VThe fluid mosaic model explains various observations regarding the structure of functional cell membranes. The model, which was devised by SJ Singer and GL Nicolson in 1972, describes the cell membrane as a two-dimensional liquid in which phospholipid and protein molecules diffuse easily.\u000a\u000aThe phospholipid bilayer is the two-layer membrane that surrounds many types of plant and animal cells. It's made up of molecules called phospholipids, which arrange themselves in two parallel layers, forming a membrane that can only be penetrated by certain types of substances. This gives the cell a clear boundary, and keeps unwanted substances out. Though the phospholipid bilayer works well most of the time, it can be damaged, and some types of unwanted substances can bypass it.

p5303
VOn the left side of the heart, the pulmonary veins empty oxygen-rich blood from the lungs into the left atrium of the heart. As the atrium contracts, blood flows from your left atrium into your left ventricle through the open mitral valve. When the ventricle is full, the mitral valve shuts.

p6021
VIt is the respiration without oxygen. Instead, after glycolysis the cell undergoes fermentation where the pyruvic acid is converted into either lactic acid or ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide. It is not very effective and only produces 2 ATP for every glucose molecule broken down. Yeast cells and some baceteria make ethanol (ethyl alcohol) and carbon dioxide and other bacteria produce lactic acid. Our muscle cells, in situations where the amount of oxygen cannot keep up with the need for energy (intense exercise), muscle cells may go to anaerobic respiration. The lactic acid causes the muscles to be sore.

sVSubstrate Orientation
p6029
VEnzyme holds the substrates in such a way that it forces the substrates together. (ex. dehydration synthesis)
p6030
sVHow is it that a single enzyme can catalyze an incredible number of reactions?
p6031
VThe enzyme has a special site, called the active site, which is a unique binding site that only a particular substrate will recognize and be able to fit inside. The active site is not changed after an enzyme catalyzes a reaction, so a new substrate can still fit in the site when the old substrate has gone away.\u000a\u000aTherefore, there are specific enzymes for specific biological reactions. Most biological reactions are also connected, meaning that the product from one enzyme-catalyzed (say, enzyme A) reaction is often used as a reactant in another reaction catalyzed by a different enzyme (say, enzyme B). The result is a complicated network of biochemical reactions.

Lysosomes are also membrane-bounded vesicles, but they are produced by the Golgi apparatus. Like peroxisomes, lysosomes digest material into simpler subunits that are sent into the cytoplasm and recycled.

sVSpecial Properties of Water:
p8789
V1. Polar molecule which makes it a great solvent \u000a2. Hydrogen bonds \u000a3. Cohesion and Adhesion \u000a These forces act together to allow water to flow upward through plants' vascular system. As water evaporates from the surface of the leaves, water molecules that are cohered to the evaporating molecules move upward. The water stays in a tubular shape because it is adhered to the molecules lining the plant's vascular tube.\u000a\u000aThe water molecules are "stuck together" and resist separating when a small amount of pressure, such as that of an insect leg, is placed on them. As a result, insects and other tiny living creatures can carry out life functions on top of the water's surface. \u000a\u000a4. High Specific Heat\u000a Large bodies of water have small ranges of temp. b/c it takes so much energy to change the temp of water; water absorbs a lot of heat from the sun and keep our planet cool\u000a\u000a5. Density\u000a When water freezes its molecules become more ridig and take up more space allowing air inb/w making it less dense allowing it to float; if it didn't float the ice would take up too much room in the water and sear levels would rise; organisms would not be able to survive in frigid areas because ice acts as an insulator and allows for an ecosystem underneath it \u000a\u000a6. Heat of vaporization\u000a Takes a tremendous amount of energy which allows organisms to use sweat as a way to get rid of heat energy and cool off the organism. \u000a\u000a7. Solvent/Solute\u000a Polar molecules make water a great solvent

p9479
Vcovalent = bond between atoms formed by sharing a pair of valence electrons, strong chemical bond, can form between two nonmetals; structural formula = formula which represents the atoms + bonding within a molecule (e.g. H \u2014 H) The line represents a shared pair of electrons; molecular formula = formula which indicates the number and types of atoms (e.g. H2); nonpolar covalent bonds = covalent bond formed by an equal sharing of electrons between atoms. Occurs when electronegativity of both atoms is about the same (e.g. CH4). Molecules made of one element usually have nonpolar covalent bonds (e.g. H2, O2, Cl2, N2); polar covalent bonds = covalent bond formed by an unequal sharing of electrons between atoms that have different electronegativities. Shared electrons spend more time around the more electronegative atom; ionic bond = can form between nonmetals and metals, bond formed by the electrostatic attraction after the complete transfer of an electron from a donor to an acceptor. Acceptor attracts electrons because it is much more electronegative than the donor atom

p10123
VThe terms 5' and 3' (read as "five prime" and "three prime") refer to the carbon atoms in a sugar molecule.\u000a\u000aEvery nucleotide is made of three parts: a phosphate group, a five-carbon (pentose) sugar, and a nitrogenous base. The 5 carbon atoms in the pentose sugar are numbered 1 - 5 for reference.\u000aIn both sugars, the number 5 carbon is the one that is NOT part of the main ring. It is found in the upper left part of each molecule in these diagrams. The number 3 carbon is the lower left carbon.\u000a\u000aWhen these sugars are included in a nucleotide, a phosphate group is attached to the number 5 carbon. This becomes the 5' end. The hydroxyl group shown in the above diagrams remains attached to the number 3 carbon. This is the 3' end of the nucleotide.\u000aWhen DNA or RNA form from individual nucleotides, the 5' (phosphate) end of one nucleotide joins to the 3' (hydroxyl) end of the next nucleotide. This gives the growing polymer directionality; the 5' end will always have a phosphate group while the 3' end always has a hydroxyl group. This directionality is vitally important when DNA is being replicated or transcribed, or when RNA is being used to make proteins.

The epididymis is a coiled structure topping the testis, and it receives immature sperm from the testis and stores it for several days. When ejaculation occurs, sperm is forcefully expelled from the tail of the epididymis into the deferent duct. Sperm then travels through the deferent duct through up the spermatic cord into the pelvic cavity, over the ureter to the prostate behind the bladder. Here, the vans deferens joins with the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct, which passes through the prostate and empties into the urethra. When ejaculation occurs, rhythmic muscle movements propel the sperm forward.

sV14) Cell cycle (interphase, mitosis/ meiosis)
p11789
VThe cell cycle or cell-division cycle is the series of events that take place in a cell leading to its division and duplication of its DNA (DNA replication) to produce two daughter cells. In bacteria, which lack a cell nucleus, the cell cycle is divided into the B, C, and D periods. The B period extends from the end of cell division to the beginning of DNA replication.\u000a\u000aInterphase is the phase of the cell cycle in which a typical cell spends most of its life. During this phase, the cell copies its DNA in preparation for mitosis. Interphase is the 'daily living' or metabolic phase of the cell, in which the cell obtains nutrients and metabolizes them, grows, reads its DNA, and conducts other "normal" cell functions.\u000a\u000aMitosis is a part of the cell cycle in which chromosomes in a cell nucleus are separated into two identical sets of chromosomes, and each set ends up in its own nucleus.\u000a\u000aMeiosis is a specialized type of cell division that reduces the chromosome number by half. This process occurs in all sexually reproducing single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes, including animals, plants, and fungi. Errors in meiosis resulting in aneuploidy are the leading known cause of miscarriage and the most frequent genetic cause of developmental disabilities.

VTemperature affects enzyme activity because enzymes are made of proteins and as the temperature raises, the protein's molecular structure will be more and more unstable until it denatures and breaks apart. The pH works essentially the same where the enzyme will denature if it is in too acidic or too basic of an environment. Cofactors are molecules that will fit into the active site of an enzyme and active/deactivate. Enzyme inhibitors are little molecules that will fit into an enzyme and prevent the cofactor from reaching it and activating it.

sVList the major components of a nucleotide, and describe how these monomers are linked to form a nucleic acid.
p14241
VA nucleotide is a monomer of a nucleic acid (thus multiple nucleotides will form a nucleic acid such as DNA or RNA). A nucleotide is consisted of a nitrogenous base (A, T, C, or G in DNA .... and A, "U", C, or G in RNA). These nitrogenous bases can be grouped as Pyrimidines ( which will be the C, U, or T) and Purines (which will be A and G). The pyrimidines are smaller in molecular size and purines are larger. The second component is a phosphate group (PO4 3-). Third will be the pentose sugar (either deoxyriboose, which will have one less oxygen b/c the prefix "de" and then oxy meaning less oxygen..... or ribose sugar, which will have an extra oxgen). As these nucleic acids are joined together (thus making a polymer, either DNA or RNA) via phosphodiester linkages, the phophate and sugar components will be have interacting forces between them (to bind them), forming a sugar-phosphate backbone. This polymer will have two distinct ends, with the top part (consisting of a phosphate group) serving as the 5' end and the bottom end (with hydroxyl group, OH, from the pentose sugar) serving as the 3' end.

sVIdentify the three types of isomers. For each type, give a key character and an example.
p17523
VStructural isomers such as pentane and 2-methylbutane differ in the covalent arrangements of their atoms; the locations of double bonds may also vary. Geometric isomers such as rhodopsin's have the same covalent partnerships, but differ in their spatial arrangements due to the inflexibility of double bonds, which must be reassembled as, unlike single bonds, they cannot simply be rotated. An atom or group of atoms attached to a double-bonded carbon may be on the same side (cis) or on opposite sides (trans). Enantiomers such as ibuprofen's differ in spatial arrangement around an asymmetric carbon, resulting in molecules that are mirror images of each other and thus named L or D after the Latin terms for left and right (levo and dextro, respectively).

V- Water has a relatively high heat of vaporization, requiring about 580 cal of heat to evaporate 1 g of water at room temperature because hydrogen bonds must be broken before a water molecule can evaporate from the liquid\u000a\u000a- Water's high heat of vaporization moderates climate\u000a\u000a- As moist tropical air moves to the poles, water vapor condenses to form rain, releasing heat

sVWhat are four methods of inhabition?
p20871
VCompetitive inhabition: the substrate and inhibitor cannot bind to the enzyme at the same time. This usually results from the inhibitor having an affinity for the active site of an enzyme where the substrate also binds; the substrate and inhibitor compete for access to the enzyme's active site.\u000a\u000aIn uncompetitive inhibition, the inhibitor binds only to the substrate-enzyme complex, it should not be confused with non-competitive inhibitors. \u000a\u000aIn non-competitive inhibition, the binding of the inhibitor to the enzyme reduces its activity but does not affect the binding of substrate. As a result, the extent of inhibition depends only on the concentration of the inhibitor. \u000a\u000aIn mixed inhibition, the inhibitor can bind to the enzyme at the same time as the enzyme's substrate. However, the binding of the inhibitor affects the binding of the substrate, and vice versa. This type of inhibition can be reduced, but not overcome by increasing concentrations of substrate. Although it is possible for mixed-type inhibitors to bind in the active site, this type of inhibition generally results from an allosteric effect where the inhibitor binds to a different site on an enzyme. Inhibitor binding to this allosteric site changes the conformation (i.e., tertiary structure or three-dimensional shape) of the enzyme so that the affinity of the substrate for the active site is reduced.

sVCompare the structure and function of actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. \u000aDifferentiate between the components of the cytoskeleton and how they provide support to the cell.
p23991
VThe cytoskeleton contains actin filaments, intermediate filaments, and microtubules. \u000aActin filaments provide structural support just under the plasma membrane as long, thin, flexible fibers that occur in bundles or mesh-like networks. (They are anchored by special proteins.) \u000aIntermediate filaments come between actin filaments and microtubules. They form a ropelike assembly of polypeptides. Some support the nuclear envelope, and others support the plasma membrane. Other still take part in the formation of cell-to-cell junctions. \u000aMicrotubules are small, hollow cylinders made of a globular protein called tubulin, which is of two types called alpha and beta. Microtubule assembly is regulated by a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in the centrosome which lies near the nucleus. They help maintain the shape of the cell and act as tracks along which organelles can be moved. (The motor molecules kinesin and dynein are associated with microtubules.)

V1. Alternative versions of genes account for variations in inherited characters. \u000a2. For each character, an organism inherits two copies (2 alleles) of a gene, one from each parent. \u000a3. If two alleles at a locus differ, then one, the *dominant allele*, determines the appearance; the other, the *recessive allele* has no noticeable effect on the organism's appearance. \u000a4. *Law of Segregation*: The two alleles for a heritable character segregate (separate from each other) during gamete formation and end up in different gametes.

Microfilaments' association with the protein myosin is responsible for muscle contraction. Microfilaments can also carry out cellular movements including gliding, contraction, and cytokinesis.\u000aMicrotubules\u000aMicrotubules are cylindrical tubes, 20-25 nm in diameter. They are composed of subunits of the protein tubulin--these subunits are termed alpha and beta. Microtubules act as a scaffold to determine cell shape, and provide a set of "tracks" for cell organelles and vesicles to move on. Microtubules also form the spindle fibers for separating chromosomes during mitosis. When arranged in geometric patterns inside flagella and cilia, they are used for locomotion.\u000aIntermediate Filaments\u000aIntermediate filaments are about 10 nm diameter and provide tensile strength for the cell.

p26127
V- A human genetic disease caused by a recessive allele that leads to the accumulation of certain lipids in the brain. \u000a- Only homozygotes have the disease, thus, at organismal level, Tay-Sachs allele is recessive. \u000a- Activity level of the enzyme in heterozygotes is in between homozygotes (normal allele) and those with Tay-Sachs disease. \u000a- Intermediate phenotype at biochemical level is incomplete dominance of either allele- however, no symptoms. \u000a- Heterozygotes produce = amounts of normal and dysfunctional enzymes- so at the molecular level, the normal allele and tay-sacks allele are codominant. \u000a- Completely dominant, incompletely dominant and codominant depend on which level the phenotype is observed.

VSaturated fats can pack more closely together.\u000aUnsaturated fats have a kink in their tails, and so do not pack together as closely.\u000a\u000aSaturated fats are used by animals because animals have to carry their energy supply with them; the saturated fat also cushions their internal organs and helps to keep them warm in colder environments.\u000a\u000aUnsaturated fats are used by plants, since they are relatively immobile and can benefit from the larger/less compact energy source.

p27864
sVDescribe the causes and consequences of acid precipitation and ocean acidification
p27865
VOcean acidification is another, and much less known, result of the approximately 79 million tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere every day, not only as a result of fossilfuel burning but also of deforestation and production of cement (7). Since the beginning of the industrial revolution, about one third ofthe CO2 released in the atmosphere by anthropogenic (human-caused) activities has been absorbed by the world's oceans,which play a key role in moderating climate change (5). Without this capacity of the oceans, the CO2 content in the atmosphere would have been much higher and global warming and its consequences more dramatic. The impacts of ocean acidification on marine ecosystems are still poorly known but one of the most likely consequences is the slower growth of organisms forming calcareous skeletons or shells, suchas corals and mollusks.; Effect on Aquatic Environment - Acid rain either falls directly on aquatic bodies or gets run off the forests, roads and fields to flow into streams, rivers and lakes. Over a period of time, acids get accumulated in the water and lower the overall pH of the water body. The aquatic plants and animals need a particular pH level of about 4.8 to survive. If the pH level falls below that the conditions become hostile for the survival of aquatic life.\u000aEffect on Forests - It makes trees vulnerable to disease, extreme weather, and insects by destroying their leaves, damaging the bark and arresting their growth. Forest damage due to acid rain is most evident in Eastern Europe - especially Germany, Poland and Switzerland.Effect on Soil - As it falls on forest or field soil, it kills useful micro-organisms and leaches nutrients of soil. Many a times, this leads to calcium and other nutrient deficiency, producing infertile soils.\u000aEffect on Architecture and Buildings - Acid rain on buildings, especially those constructed with limestone, react with the minerals and corrode them away. This leaves the building weak and susceptible to decay. Modern buildings, cars, airplanes, steel bridges and pipes are all affected by acid rain. Irreplaceable damage can be caused to the old heritage buildings.\u000aEffect on Public Health - When in atmosphere, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide gases and their particulate matter derivatives like sulfates and nitrates, degrades visibility and can cause accidents, leading to injuries and deaths.\u000a- See more at: http://www.conserve-energy-future.com/causes-and-effects-of-acid-rain.php#sthash.UCXzA4Be.dpuf

VCarbonic acid, formed when CO2 reacts with water in blood plasma, dissociates to yield a bicarbonate ion and a hydrogen ion. The carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffering system consists of an acid and a base in equilibrium with each other. As carbonic acid acts as an acidic H+ donor and the bicarbonate ion acts as a basic H+ acceptor, the reaction shifts towards the products in response to a rise in pH and towards the reactant in response to a drop in pH, thus maintaining a relatively stable pH range.

VPeroxisomes are membrane bound vesicles that contain enzymes. The enzymes' actions results in the formation of H2O2 (hydrogen peroxide) which is a toxic molecule. (The hydrogen peroxide is immediately broken down into water and oxygen by another peroxisomal enzyme, catalase.) Peroxisomes are metabolic assistants to the other organelles of the cell, especially cells that synthesize and break down lipids. \u000a\u000aVacuoles are membranous sacs that are larger than vesicles. They usually store substances. They are essential to plant function because they contain not only water, sugars, and salts but also water soluble pigments and toxic molecules.

sVHow does phototropism work
p28601
VAuxins drive phototropism. If a stem is unequally illuminated, auxin will move down from the apical meristem, concentrating on the SHADY SIDE.

Water surging into the cell makes the cell elongate and swell because of turgor pressure, thus making the cell grow. .\u000a\u000aThe growth on the shady side, moves it towards the light.

sVCalculate the efficiency of respiration in generating ATP
p28973
VSince a glucose generates a maximum of 38 molecules of ATP with each molecule containing about 7.3 kcal of energy, the total amount of energy produced will be :\u000a\u000a38 * 7.3 kcal = 277.4 kcal\u000a\u000aSince Glucose contains 686 kcal of energy but only generates 277.4 kcal of energy via aerobic respiration, the % of kcal in glucose converted to ATP will be:\u000a(Amount of Kcal in glucose generated into ATP / Overall amount of kcal within glucose) * 100%\u000a\u000a( 277.4 / 686 ) * 100% = 40.4% (3 significant Figures)\u000a\u000ab) As you can see only 40.4% of the energy stored within the glucose is converted into ATP, so what happens to the rest of the 59.6%?\u000a\u000aThe rest of the energy actually goes into the process of the creation of ATP. Physically, they are turned into ATP, but due to the need for energy to activate the ATP converting mechanism in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of cells, the 59.6% of the energy (in ATP form) in turn used up by the mechanism, thus not counted in the net creation of ATP, as what the question is looking for is the net creation of ATP usable by the body.\u000a\u000aSo what are the mechanisms that uses up ATP? 2 of them are:\u000a\u000a1) Glycosis:\u000aDuring Glycosis, 4 ATP is supposed to be created through the process, but due to the energy needed to keep it running, only a net of 2 ATP is produced.\u000a\u000a2) Oxidative Phosphorylation\u000aIn the oxidative Phosphorylation, Large amounts of ATP is generated by the body (the largest amount as compared to the Glycosis and Citric acid cycle) at around 30 to 36 ATP. Despite the production of the large amount of ATP, quite a bit of ATP is actually used up. In the oxidative phosphorylation, in order to generate the large amount of energy, the mechanism utilizes the power of concentration gradients, by pumping ions (H+ ions obtained from oxidative reactions during the glycosis and citric acid cycles carried over by NAD+) across the membrane of the mitochondria of the cell through active transport. Due to the huge difference of concentration of ions, large amount of ATP is able to be generated by pumping them back into the mitochondria through a turbine-like mechanism in the membrane of the mitochondria, which in turn, generates ATP.\u000a\u000aDuring the active transport process, however, energy (ATP) is used up in order to overcome the concentration gradient and continue to pump ions to an area of higher concentration in order for the oxidate phosphorylation which depends on the concentration gradient between the two areas across the membrane to function effective. Therefore also causes a loss of net energy produced

This is where we find the brain power to develop language, abstract thought, consciousness and imagination. The neo-cortex is divided into two hemispheres, right and left. The right side of the brain controls the left side of the body and the left side of the brain controls the right side of the body. The hemispheres are divided in terms of what kind of thought they process or produce. The right being more concerned with the artistic, spatial and musical. While the left is more concerned with the colder, linear, rational and verbal aspects. The neo-cortex is located on the outer surface of the brain and is divided into four major lobes: Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe, Temporal Lobe and Occipital Lobe.

sVDistinguish between competitive and non-competitive or allosteric inhibition.
p29947
VNon-competitive inhibition involves an inhibitor molecule binding to the enzyme at a different area, changing the conformation of the enzyme and altering the shape of the active site. As a result the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme is reduced and the shape of the active site may be so altered that the reaction cannot occur. This type of inhibition may or may not be reversible.\u000a\u000aInhibition is usually reversible unless the inhibitor is some kind of poison. Penicillin, for example, causes the death of bacteria due to irreversible inhibition of an enzyme needed to form the bacterial cell wall. In humans, hydrogen cyanide irreversibly binds to cytochrome oxidase present in all cells with lethal consequences\u000a\u000aAllosteric regulation is the regulation of an enzyme or protein by binding an effector molecule at the protein's allosteric site (that is, a site other than the protein's active site). Effectors that enhance the protein's activity are referred to as allosteric activators, whereas those that decrease the protein's activity are called allosteric inhibitors. The term allostery comes from the Greek allos, "other," and stereos, "space," referring to the regulatory site of an allosteric protein's being separate from its active site. Allosteric regulation is a natural example of feedback control.\u000a\u000aAllosteric inhibitors are modulator molecules which bind somewhere besides the active site, change the enzyme's shape and "turn off" the catalytic activity

p32651
VLatitude affects climate because the closer any certain area is to the equator, that area will have a higher overall temperature (3 zones; polar, temperature, tropical)\u000aLatitude affects climate because the farther away you are from the equator, the colder it is. This is due to the fact that the earths curvature causes the sun's rays to be more concentrated at the equator and more spread out. So, farther north, in the Arctic, the sunlight is less concentrated as it is spread out over a larger area of land. In Brazil, for example, it is closer to the equator, so the sunlight would be much more concentrated, therefore warmer.

sVWhat role does a transmembrane protein play?
p33205
V1. Signaling to the cell what the external environment contains. Receptors are capable of interacting with specific substrate molecules on the extracellular domain. Once a protein binds to substrate, a change in the geometry near the binding site results in subsequent changes in the structure of the intercellular domain. These changes result in a cascade effect\u2014another protein in the cell changes, affecting the next protein, and so on. Thus, transmembrane proteins are capable of initiating signals that are responsive to the external environment of the cell but ultimately lead to actions that take place in other structures of the cell.\u000a2. Controlling the exchange of materials across the membrane.The proteins most involved in this process are called porins. These molecules appear in clusters that create pores (or channels) within the membrane. In many cases the pores are controlled (or regulated) by other proteins so that they are open under some circumstances and closed under others.

VThe Atrio-ventricular Valves which separate the atria from the ventricles, allow blood to flow from the atria to the ventricles, but prevent flow in the opposite direction. The right AV Valves is called the Tricuspid Valve. The left AV Valve is called the Mitral Valve. The opening and closing of the AV Valves is dependent on pressure differences between the atria and ventricles. When the ventricles relax, atrial pressure exceeds ventricular pressure, the AV Valves are pushed open and blood flows into the ventricles. However, when the ventricles contract, ventricular pressure exceeds atrial pressure causing the AV Valves to snap shut.

sVDescribe the mechanisms by which enzymes lower activation energy
p33971
VALL enzymes lower the activation energy by lowering the potential energy(stabilizing) of the transition state. The electrons in a transition state can be stabilized by the enzyme when they interact with another ion, atom, or molecule.\u000a\u000aSome but not all enzymes catalyze reactions by providing an alternate mechanism for the reaction, a new, lower energy pathway. In this case the enzyme produces intermediate(s) (that is eventually used up) to synthesize a product. For example:\u000a\u000aSubstrate + enzyme --> C\u000aC + B --> product + enzyme\u000aC represents an intermediate, B is a another substrate\u000a\u000aThen again only some enzymes provide alternate mechanisms, but ALL enzymes stabilize transition states.

p34115
VMitochondria and chloroplasts have elaborate internal membrane that provide the framework for harnessing energy for biological purposes using chemiosmotic coupling. This happens in two stages:\u000aStage 1. High-energy electrons (derived from the oxidation of food molecules, from the action of sunlight, or from other sources) are transferred along a series of electron carriers embedded in the membrane. These electron transfers release energy that is used to pump protons (H+, derived from the water that is ubiquitous in cells) across the membrane and thus generate an electrochemical proton gradient. An ion gradient across a membrane is a form of stored energy, which can be harnessed to do useful work when the ions are allowed to flow back across the membrane down their electrochemical gradient.\u000a\u000aStage 2. H+ flows back down its electrochemical gradient through a protein machine called ATP synthase, which catalyzes the energy-requiring synthesis of ATP from ADP and inorganic phosphate (Pi). This ubiquitous enzyme plays the role of a turbine, permitting the proton gradient to drive the production of ATP (Figure 14-1).

sVFunctions of Secretion From the Digestive System: The Small Intestine
p34309
VThe Small Intestine is made up of three segments. These are called: The Duodenum, the Jejunum, and the Ileum. The small intestine is a 22 foot long muscular tube that breaks down food using enzymes released by the pancreas and bile from the liver. Peristalsis also is at work in this organ moving food through and mixing it with digestive secretions from the pancreas and liver. The duodenum is largely responsible for the continuous breaking down process with the jejunum and ileum mainly responsible for absorption of nutrients into the bloodstream. Contents of the small intestine start out semi-solid and end in a liquid form after passing through the organ. Water, bile, enzymes and mucous contribute to the change in consistency. Once the nutrients have been absorbed and the left over food residue liquid has passed through the small intestine, it then moves on to the large intestine or colon.

In these two proteins, the left side is a single pass protein and the right side protein is a multi-pass protein. \u000a\u000aIntegral proteins are mainly found either fully or partially submerged in the phospholipids bilayer of the plasma membrane. These proteins have both polar and non-polar regions on them. Polar heads protrude from the surface of the bilayer while non-polar regions are embedded in it. Usually only the non-polar regions interact with the hydrophobic core of the plasma membrane by making hydrophobic bonds with the fatty acid tails of the phospholipids.\u000a\u000aThe integral proteins that span the entire membrane from the inner surface to the outer surface are called transmembrane proteins. In transmembrane proteins, both ends that project out of the lipid layer are polar or hydrophilic regions. The middle regions are non-polar and have hydrophobic amino acids on their surface

sV12) Cellular respiration (glycolysis, oxidation of pyruvate, Krebs cycle, electron transportation chain; lactate & ethanol fermentation)
p34663
VThe biochemical processes of the cell are known as cellular respiration. Many of the reactions involved in cellular respiration happen in the mitochondria. Mitochondria are the working organelles that keep the cell full of energy.\u000a\u000aGlycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO + H. The free energy released in this process is used to form the high-energy compounds ATP (adenosine triphosphate) and NADH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide).\u000a\u000aAcetyl-CoA may then be used in the citric acid cycle to carry out cellular respiration, and this complex links the glycolysis metabolic pathway to the citric acid cycle. Pyruvate decarboxylation is also known as the "pyruvate dehydrogenase reaction" because it also involves the oxidation of pyruvate.\u000a\u000aThe citric acid cycle - also known as the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or the Krebs cycle - is a series of chemical reactions used by all aerobic organisms to generate energy through the oxidation of acetyl-CoA derived from carbohydrates, fats and proteins into carbon dioxide and chemical energy in the form of guanosine triphosphate (GTP).\u000a\u000aAn electron transport chain (ETC) is a series of compounds that transfer electrons from electron donors to electron acceptors via redox reactions, and couples this electron transfer with the transfer of protons (H ions) across a membrane.\u000a\u000aLactic acid fermentation is a biological process by which glucose and other six-carbon sugars (also, disaccharides of six-carbon sugars, e.g. sucrose or lactose) are converted into cellular energy and the metabolite lactate. It is an anaerobic fermentation reaction that occurs in some bacteria and animal cells, such as muscle cells.\u000a\u000aEthanol fermentation, also called alcoholic fermentation, is a biological process which converts sugars such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose into cellular energy, producing ethanol and carbon dioxide as a side-effect. Because yeasts perform this conversion in the absence of oxygen, alcoholic fermentation is considered an anaerobic process.

p35207
VChromatin is the uncondensed version of DNA before mitosis. When Prophase begins chromatin condenses into chromosomes by wrapping around histones. Ones chromosomes are formed, they line up on metaphase plate and are pulled apart during anaphase. Each part of the chromosome, called a chromatid, becomes a "chromosome" again, although it is only half. The other half is replicated during interphase prior to the next cell division.

p35267
VThe Limbic System sometimes called the emotional brain, is the next part of the brain to have evolved in the more primitive mammals about 150 million years ago. This is where our emotions reside, where memory begins and where these two functions combine together to mark behaviors with positive or negative feelings. It's where mostly unconscious value judgments are made. Information going through the limbic system are filed under agreeable or disagreeable. It also plays a role in what grabs your attention, spontaneity and creativity. The limbic system is the set of brain structures that forms the inner border of the cortex.

p37373
VHeart Valves functions are to ensure a one-way flow of blood through the heart. The valves are not made of muscle, but rather are composed of sheets of tough connective tissue, leaflets, that act like flaps. The heart valves open and close passively because of the pressure of differences on either side of the valve. When the pressure is greater behind the valve, the leaflets are blown open and the blood flows through the valve. However, when pressure is grater in front of the valve, the leaflets snap shut and blood flow is stopped. The motion of a heart valve is analogous to the motion of the front door of your house. The door, which only opens in one direction, opens and closes due to pressure on the door.

sVDiscuss how CO2 emissions affect marine life and ecosystems.
p37565
VAbout half the CO2 emitted stays in atmosphere, acting like a reflective blanket over the planet that traps heat by preventing it from escaping into outer space. While photosynthesizing organisms absorb some of the gas, approximately 30% is taken up by the oceans, and excessive CO2 uptake might damage the fragile marine ecosystem. For instance, exorbitant levels of CO2 lead to excessive bicarbonate ion levels, necessarily involving a reduction in carbonate ion levels, which has a negative impact on calcification, the process that allows for the formation of coral reefs, an environment crucial for the sustenance of many diverse marine organisms. One study predicted that the expected doubling of CO2 emissions by 2065 could lead to a 40% decrease in coral reef calcification. Chemical imbalances in ocean water can also have a tremendous influence on weather systems.

p37981
Vthese specialized plants are able to prevent photorespiration from happening by TEMPORALLY separating carbon fixation from the Calvin Cycle.

sVFunctions of Secretion From the Digestive System: The Rectum
p38141
VThe Rectum which is Latin for "straight", is an 8 inch chamber that connects the colon to the anus. It is the rectum's job to receive stool from the colon, to let the person know that there is stool to be evacuated, and to hold the stool until evacuation happens. When anything, gas or stool, comes into the rectum, sensors send a message to the brain. The brain then decides if the rectal contents can be released or not. If they can, the sphincters relax and the rectum contracts, disposing its contents. If the contents cannot be disposed, the sphincter contracts and the rectum accommodates so that the sensation temporarily goes away.

sVBlood Flow Through the Heart: The Lungs
p38721
VOnce blood travels through the pulmonic valve, it enters your lungs. This is called the pulmonary circulation. From your pulmonic valve, blood travels to the pulmonary artery to tiny capillary vessels in the lungs. Oxygen travels from the tiny air sacs in the lungs through the walls of the capillaries into the blood. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product of metabolism, passes from the blood into the air sacs. Carbon dioxide leaves the body when you exhale. Once the blood is purified and oxygenated, it travels back to the left atrium through the pulmonary veins.

VCarl Linneaus was interested in plants and the naming of them. He was unhappy with the way other scientists named and grouped plants so he came up with his own system for the plants and the reproductive of plants. His system came up with two names. The first name would be the "genus" of the plant and the second name would be the "species" of the plant. He became known as the father of Taxonomy. This was his system for naming, ranking and classifying plant and animal names. As he was taught in his early years by his father, he did not believe in evolution. He was told that species were permanent and therefore, did not change. As he got older, and noticed different species in plants previous studied, he changed his mind on evolution.

VThe cohesion of water allows a long string of water molecules to be hydrogen bonded to all the way from the roots to the leaves in a long train of water molecules. Adhesion helps this process with capillary action, where the water that is attracted to the side of the of the xylem vessels, which allows other water molecules to move further up. Finally, transpiration acts as a water "pump" against gravity, by having water molecules evaporate out through the stomata on the leaves of plants, and this evaporation action pulls the chain of water molecules up behind it.

sVFunctions of Secretion From the Digestive System: The Anus
p42521
VThe Anus is the last part of the digestive tract. It is a 2 inch long canal consisting of the pelvic floor muscles and the two anal sphincters, internal and external. The lining of the upper anus is specialized to detect rectal contents. It lets you know whether the contents are liquid, gas, or solid. The anus is surrounded by sphincter muscles that are important in allowing control of stool. The pelvic floor muscle creates an angle between the rectum and the anus that stops stool from coming out when it is not supposed to. The internal sphincter is always tight, except when stool enters the rectum. It keeps us continent when we are asleep or otherwise unaware of the presence of stool. When we get an urge to go to the bathroom, we rely on our external sphincter to hold the stool until reaching a toilet, where it then relaxes to release the contents.

VThe young scientist first made his mark in the world of chemistry with his use of X-rays to examine the molecular structure of crystals. This work led him to a more thorough investigation of the nature of the chemical bond. Pauling revolutionized chemistry in the 1920s with his application of quantum physics to the study of chemistry. He used the new theory of wave mechanics to explain molecular structures which had baffled chemists for years. Pauling's resonance theory proposed that some molecules "resonate" between different structures, rather than holding a single fixed structure. This insight made possible the creation of many of the drugs, dyes, plastics and synthetic fibers we take for granted today.

sVFunctions of Secretion From the Digestive System: The Large Intestine, the Colon
p43413
VThe Large Intestine, or the Colon, is a 6 foot long muscular tube that connects the small intestine to the rectum. The large intestine is made up of the cecum; the ascending (right) colon, the transverse (across) colon, the descending (left) colon, and the sigmoid colon which connects to the rectum. The appendix is a small tube attached to the cecum. The large intestine is a highly specialized organ that is responsible for processing waste so that emptying the bowels is easy and convenient. Stool or waste left over from the digestive process is passed through the colon by means of peristalsis, first in liquid state and ultimately in a solid form. As stool passes through the colon, water is removed. The stool is stored in the sigmoid (S-shaped) colon until a mass movement empties it into the rectum once or twice a day. It normally takes about 36 hours for stool to get through the colon. The tool itself is mostly of food debris and bacteria. These bacteria perform several useful functions such as synthesizing various vitamins, processing waste products and food particles, and protecting against harmful bacteria. When the descending colon becomes full of stool, or feces, it empties its content into the rectum to begin the process of elimination.

Three possible genotypes are AA, BB, OO that correspond to the phenotypes of blood type A, B, and O respectively; Two other genotypes are AO and BO that correspond to blood types A and B, respectively because the O allele is recessive, The remaining genotype is AB, corresponding to blood type AB. Both the A and B alleles contribute to the phenotype of the heterozygote. Thus the alleles A and B are said to be co-dominant.

p45927
VIV. Water's Life-Supporting Properties\u000aA. 2.10 Hydrogen bonds make liquid water cohesive\u000a1. The tendency of molecules of the same kind to stick together is cohesion.\u000aa. Cohesion is much stronger for water than other liquids.\u000ab. Most plants depend upon cohesion to help transport water and nutrients from their\u000aroots to their leaves.\u000a2. The tendency of two kinds of molecules to stick together is adhesion.\u000a3. Cohesion is related to surface tension\u2014a measure of how difficult it is to break the\u000asurface of a liquid.\u000aa. Hydrogen bonds give water high surface tension, making it behave as if it were\u000acoated with an invisible film.\u000ab. Water striders stand on water without breaking the water surface.\u000aB. 2.11 Water's hydrogen bonds moderate temperature\u000a1. Because of hydrogen bonding, water has a greater ability to resist temperature change\u000athan other liquids.\u000aa. Heat is the energy associated with movement of atoms and molecules in matter.\u000ab. Temperature measures the intensity of heat.\u000a2. Heat is released when hydrogen bonds form.\u000a3. Heat must be absorbed to break hydrogen bonds.\u000a4. When a substance evaporates, the surface of the liquid that remains behind cools\u000adown, in the process of evaporative cooling.\u000a5. This cooling occurs because the molecules with the greatest energy leave the surface.\u000aC. 2.12 Ice is less dense than liquid water\u000a1. Water can exist as a gas, liquid, or solid.\u000a2. Water is less dense as a solid than a liquid because of hydrogen bonding.\u000a3. When water freezes, each molecule forms a stable hydrogen bond with its neighbors.\u000aa. As ice crystals form, the molecules are less densely packed than in liquid water.\u000ab. Because ice is less dense than water, it floats.\u000aD. 2.13 Water is the solvent of life\u000a1. A solution is a liquid consisting of a uniform mixture of two or more substances.\u000aa. The dissolving agent is the solvent.\u000ab. The substance that is dissolved is the solute.\u000ac. An aqueous solution is one in which water is the solvent.\u000a2. Water's versatility as a solvent results from the polarity of its molecules.\u000a3. Polar or charged solutes dissolve when water molecules surround them, forming aqueous\u000asolutions.\u000a4. Table salt is an example of a solute that will go into solution in water.\u000aE. 2.14 The chemistry of life is sensitive to acidic and basic conditions\u000a1. In aqueous solutions, a small percentage of water molecules break apart into ions.\u000aa. Some are hydrogen ions (H+\u000a).\u000ab. Some are hydroxide ions (OH-\u000a).

Like the RAM in your computer it processes and stores new and temporary memory for long term storage. It's also involved in interpreting incoming nerve signals and spatial relationships. The hippocampus is part of the limbic system and is part of the brain located in the temporal lobe behind the ear.

p49412
sV7 differences between a prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell
p49413
V1. Eukaryotic cells have a true nucleus, bound by a double membrane. Prokaryotic cells have no nucleus. The purpose of the nucleus is to sequester the DNA-related functions of the big eukaryotic cell into a smaller chamber, for the purpose of increased efficiency. This function is unnecessary for the prokaryotic cell, because its much smaller size means that all materials within the cell are relatively close together. Of course, prokaryotic cells do have DNA and DNA functions. Biologists describe the central region of the cell as its "nucleoid" (-oid=similar or imitating), because it's pretty much where the DNA is located. But note that the nucleoid is essentially an imaginary "structure." There is no physical boundary enclosing the nucleoid. \u000a\u000a2. Eukaryotic DNA is linear; prokaryotic DNA is circular (it has no ends). \u000a\u000a3. Eukaryotic DNA is complexed with proteins called "histones," and is organized into chromosomes; prokaryotic DNA is "naked," meaning that it has no histones associated with it, and it is not formed into chromosomes. Though many are sloppy about it, the term "chromosome" does not technically apply to anything in a prokaryotic cell. A eukaryotic cell contains a number of chromosomes; a prokaryotic cell contains only one circular DNA molecule and a varied assortment of much smaller circlets of DNA called "plasmids." The smaller, simpler prokaryotic cell requires far fewer genes to operate than the eukaryotic cell. \u000a\u000a4. Both cell types have many, many ribosomes, but the ribosomes of the eukaryotic cells are larger and more complex than those of the prokaryotic cell. Ribosomes are made out of a special class of RNA molecules (ribosomal RNA, or rRNA) and a specific collection of different proteins. A eukaryotic ribosome is composed of five kinds of rRNA and about eighty kinds of proteins. Prokaryotic ribosomes are composed of only three kinds of rRNA and about fifty kinds of protein. \u000a\u000a5. The cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells is filled with a large, complex collection of organelles, many of them enclosed in their own membranes; the prokaryotic cell contains no membrane-bound organelles which are independent of the plasma membrane. This is a very significant difference, and the source of the vast majority of the greater complexity of the eukaryotic cell. There is much more space within a eukaryotic cell than within a prokaryotic cell, and many of these structures, like the nucleus, increase the efficiency of functions by confining them within smaller spaces within the huge cell, or with communication and movement within the cell. \u000a\u000a6. Eukaryotic cells are the largest cells, while Prokaryotic cells are smaller than Eukaryotic cells. A eukartotic cell is about 10 times bigger than a prokaryotic cell. \u000a\u000a7. Eukaryotic cells either have a plasma membrane or a cell wall in addition to the plasma membrane; prokaryotic cells have a plasma membrane in addition to a bacterial cell wall
