p561
VDuring the course of United States history there have been two migration "waves". One in the early 1900's around the time of world war 1 and the second from 1940ish to september 11, 2001. The first wave was created because the United States allowed anyone to migrate to the United States mainly because it was in the middle of its industrial stage and needed people to take jobs for businesses to thrive. But when World War 1 started many southern and Western Europeans began migrating to the United States causing the first "spike" in immigrants. Congress decided to stop the increased migration from Europe by passing a law that only allowed the amount 3% of 1910's migrants from Europe to be allowed to migrate into the country, but Congress didn't think it was enough so they changed the law to only 2% of 1890 thus ending the first wave migration. The second migration began close after the end of the first wave. Immigrants from countries in the Caribbean and central America began to cross the borders into America illegally. After hurricane Katrina and poverty in Haiti many more immigrants illegally tried to smuggle themselves into the country. The immigration count rose steadily until September 11, 2001. When Congress began taking extreme measures to slow illegal migration into the U.S. They had fences built across the borders of Mexico and parts of Canada. As well as increased coast guard protection along states on the Gulf of Mexico where many immigrants were entering by boat.

p945
VThe Self-Sufficiency approach was used by China, India, Eastern European and African Nations. This model suggests that money be spent evenly in all sectors so that all people and industries feel valued. The growth may not be dramatic, but it will be equitable. Urban and rural areas will grow at the same speed and poverty will be diminished rather than several people becoming wealthy. Businesses are kept national or even local to protect them from international competition. Limits on imports and increased tariffs to stop international trade, quotas on imports, licensing required for import companies, high tariffs to make imports more expensive than domestic products. India used self-sufficiency by requiring complicated licensing for imports, limiting exports, increasing tariffs and supporting Indian products made for the Indian people (government incentives for following their guidelines)\u000aProblems with Self-Sufficiency. Businesses are inefficient on the global scale and have been protected by government policies that will eventually hurt business. Bureaucracy (government control and "red tape") have to be huge and complex - this can lead to corruption and ineffective rules and regulations.\u000a\u000aDevelopment through International Trade.\u000aIn International Trade development countries identify the resource or manufactured program that they have in abundance (or can make in abundance) and which other countries want (supply and demand). The nation should focus all of its financial resources into one area and then when money comes in it can be spread to other areas.

Instead of relying on one specific location or point of profit, an industry should determine a region or optimal locations that would allow for maximizing profits as much as possible. This theory also considers consumer demand and production costs while accounting for the substitution principle. In Lösch's theory, there are assumptions of an isotropic plain, rational consumers, evenly distributed population, uniform demand, consumer payments of shipping costs, and the possibility of new production plants into the market. With all this in mind, there is a "zone of profitability" (Spatial Margin of Profitiability) in which the greatest net profit for industry is possible.

He studied forms of internal migration in England and produced the laws listed above which are still commonly found today.

sVcharacterize a refugee and refugee population
p4562
VA refugee is someone who has migrated away from their home in order to escape some power that threatens them. The British definition of a refugee is: "A person who has a wellfounded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, member-ship or a particular social group, or political opinion." Some countries find this incorrect mainly because of the word "wellfounded" which could be judged in many different ways. For example, according the the British definition, victims of hurricane Katrina do not count as refugees. People like these are called Internally displaced persons or IDPs. These people have been forced to leave their homes but not cross any international borders. A refugee population is when a large group of refugees, fleeing from the same cause, form a community together. Normally these communities are very small and very poor.

Some similarities include:\u000a--Old colonial port zone surrounded by a commercial business district\u000a--Western commercial zone (dominated by Chinese merchants)\u000a--No formal central business district (CBD)\u000a--Hybrid sectors & zones growing rapidly\u000a--New Industrial parks on the outskirts of the city\u000a-Key Concepts:\u000a--The Southeast Asian City Model is similar to the Latin American (Griffin-Ford) City Model in that they each feature high-class residential zones that stem from the center, middle-class residential zones that occur in inner-city areas, and low-income squatter settlements that occur in the periphery\u000a--The main difference between the two models is that the Southeast Asian City Model features middle-income housing in suburban areas. This reflects the larger percentage of middle-class citizens that reside in the peripheral regions than those of Latin America. This may reflect a smaller MC in Latin-American? cities by comparison\u000a--Due to the alien commercial zone these cities also experience a blended culture but also strong ethnic ties

sVExplain why Western Europe's population needs immigrants and how they're reacting.
p7488
V1. Europe needs the economy boost that immigrants provide tremendously. They do the hard, labouring jobs that other native westerners won't do. Europe produces lots of job oppurtunities that aren't being filled by natives. Also, demographically Europe has low fertility rates and needs immigrants to help stabilize the population. People react differently to immigrants. Though some countries are more embracing than others, the vast majority of Europe is beginning to oppose the immigrants for taking jobs, bringing dangerous extremist ideals, and for making their country less native. People are outraged at the culture they're losing. Europe is quite progressive and fairly wealthy but in order to secure its wealth for the future it needs immigrants to flood the workforce. The UK recently opened their doors to Eastern Europe estimating a much smaller number of immigrants than it recieved. Britain is a large producer of jobs and the economy is phenomal compared to the rest of the world.

V- The city is located centrally within an "Isolated State" which is self sufficient and has no external influences.\u000aThe Isolated State is surrounded by an unoccupied wilderness.\u000a- The land of the State is completely flat and has no rivers or mountains to interrupt the terrain.\u000a- The soil quality and climate are consistent throughout the State.\u000a- Farmers in the Isolated State transport their own goods to market via oxcart, across land, directly to the central city. Therefore, there are no roads.\u000a- Farmers act to maximize profits.\u000a- Dairying and intensive farming occur in the ring closest to the city.\u000a- Since vegetables, fruit, milk and other dairy products must get to market quickly, they would be produced close to the city (no refrigeration)\u000a- Timber and firewood would be produced for fuel and building materials in the second zone.\u000a- The third zone consists of extensive fields crops such as grains for bread. Since grains last longer than dairy products and are much lighter than fuel, reducing transport costs, they can be located further from the city.\u000a- Ranching is located in the final ring surrounding the central city. Animals can be raised far from the city because they are self-transporting. Animals can walk to the central city for sale or for butchering.\u000a- Beyond the fourth ring lies the unoccupied wilderness, which is too great a distance from the central city for any type of agricultural product.

Basically, industries locate themselves according to the location of their competition so that they will have the chance to lure consumers and profit from the sales. However, this model also considers production costs and the size of the market before determining a location for industry. Plus, this theory also assumes production costs, product selection, and consumer demand is uniform or equal in all aspects.

Areas closer to the city are used for the purposes they are used for because of the decaying nature of the product (milk) or because of its bulkiness (lumber). This theory is also known as the "Theory of Land Rent", because the rents of certain areas reflected the commodity and nature of the commodity that was grown in the region.

p16720
VMigration trend follow demographic transition stages. People become increasingly mobile as industrialization develops.

Stage- 4 countries show less emigration and more intraregional migration.
p16721
sVcorrelate migration patterns to the demographic transition model
p16722
Vcitizens in stage 2 and early 3 are more likely to emigrate from their country and immigrate into another country whereas citizens in late 3 and early 4 are more likely to get immigrants than have emigrants. The demographic model shows the average population growth in an area that is becoming industrialized. If migration was to enter into a country during the course of the model, populations may change up the data and come to a different conclusion. People migrate to a place where they expect to have better life; If an area begins to push into the second or third stage of the model (when the country begins to industrialize) People will begin to think that they can have a better life in that country. So they migrate to the country and cause the total population of the growing country to skyrocket because of the increase in immigrants and lowered death rates.

p19367
VDesigned to explain the spatial distribution of human settlements. Central places are settlements providing services to their surrounding "market areas". The ordering of settlements based on the number and level of services they provide produces a hierarchy. Hierarchies are often complicated because market areas of different-order settlements overlap (shown as solid and broken lines).\u000aThe theory relied on two main concepts:\u000a Threshold - the minimum market needed to bring about the selling of a good or service.\u000a Range - the maximum distance people will travel to acquire the good or service.\u000aFour generalizations can be made regarding the spacing, size and function of settlements. The greater the size of the central place:\u000a1. the fewer they are in number;\u000a2. the greater the distance between them;\u000a3. the greater the number and range of functions;\u000a4. the greater the number of higher-order services (e.g., arenas, universities, museums, zoos, etc.)

p19623
VCommerce (large department stores/chain stores) is willing to pay the greatest rent to be located in the CBD. It is traditionally the most accessible location for a large population, which is essential for retail stores, which require considerable turnover. Willing and able to pay a very high land rent value. As you move from the CBD, commerce is unwilling to pay as much for a site. Industry is willing to pay to be on the outskirts of the CBD. There is more land available for their factories, but they still have many of the benefits of the CBD. As you move further out, so the land is less attractive to industry and the householder is able to purchase land. The further you go from the CBD, the cheaper the land - this is why inner city areas are very densely populated (terraces and high rises), while the suburbs and rural areas are sparsely populated (semi and detached houses). The pattern is never as simple in reality. Today, out-of-town shopping centers and industrial sites have influenced the pattern.

VIn 1967, urban geographer T. G. McGee studied the medium\u2010sized cities of Southeast Asia and found that they exhibit similar land\u2010use patterns, creating a model referred to as the McGee model. The focal point of the city is the old colonial port zone combined with the largely commercial district that surrounds it. McGee found no formal central business district; rather, he found the elements of the CBD present as separate clusters surrounding the old colonial port zone: the government zone; the Western commercial zone (practically a CBD by itself); the alien commercial zone, dominated by Chinese merchants whose residences are attached to their places of business; and the mixed land\u2010use zone that contains miscellaneous economic activities, including light industry. The other nonresidential areas are the market\u2010gardening zone at the outskirts of the urban area and, still farther from the city, a recently built industrial park or "estate."

Some immigration of unskilled workers, and skilled workers may be exchanged between countries as a result of multi-national companies. Stage 5: Advanced societies will have mostly inter or intra urban migration although new technology will reduce the need for migration. Mobility between and within countries may be affected by state legisltaion.

In the beginning, many of these immigrants came to Europe as slaves, but in the 20th century immigrants from Africa and Asia served as soldiers and contract laborers in the European armies during the two World Wars. In addition, the wave of decolonization after World War II stimulated millions of former European colonists as well as people of mixed descent and various colonial minority groups such as the Chinese to migrate to Europe in spite of the fact that the large majority of these migrants had never lived or visited there.

sV"The miracle of the cerrado"
p33868
VSummary: Brazil has transformed itself into one of the world's breadbaskets in less than 30 years. Between 1996 and 2006, the total value of the country's crops rose from 23 billion reais to 108 billion reais. Brazil has also done all of this without much government subsidy and without deforesting the Amazon. Brazil has both more available farmland and more renewable water than any other country. Much of this is due to Empresa Brasileira de Pesquisa Agropecuaria (Embrapa), a public company set up in 1973. Embrapa turned the cerrado, soils no one thought would be productive due to their acidity and lack of nutrients, into productive farmland in four steps.\u000a1. It poured pulverized limestone at industrial quantities onto the soil to reduce acidity. Embrapa scientists bred varieties of rhizobrium, bacteria that helps fix nitrogen in legumes and reduce the need for fertilizers.\u000a2. Embrapa brought back a type of grass from Africa and crossbred it to create a new breed which produced many time what native cerrando grass produces, turning parts of the cerrando into a pasture.\u000a3. Embrapa turned soyabeans into a tropical crop through GM.\u000a4. Embrapa pioneered and encouraged new farming techniques and technologies (specifically no till farming and forest, agriculture, and livestock integration).\u000aMany hope that the techniques developed by the Brazilians can be brought to Africa to take advantage of the vast amount of available land.

The location that generates the greatest profit will be preferred.\u000aThis can be determined by identifying production costs at various locations, and then taking into account the size of the market area that each location is able to control.\u000aProducers/suppliers will monopolize as many consumers as possible - they seek spatial monopoly (locational interdependence).

sVVon Thunen, Johann Heinrich
p40970
V1826, Northern Germany. When choosing an enterprise, a commercial farmer compares two costs; cost of the land versus the cost of transporting production to market. Identifies a crop that can be sold for more than the land cost, distance of land to market is critical because the cost of transporting varies by crop. Also found that specific crops were grown in varying rings around city. Market-oriented gardens and milk producers in first ring, because of expense of transportation and perish-ability. In the next rings wood lots used for construction and fuel, because it is a heavy industry with high transportation costs. Next rings are used for various crops or pasture, with the outermost ring devoted to animal grazing. Von Thunen's theory disregards site or human factors.

These Europeans were making plantations or large farms that required lots of time and man power to generate enough money to keep the plantation working. The owners decided to find slaves who would work on the plantation for little to no cost. The owners would buy slaves from Europeans shippers, who in turn would pay African raiders for slaves. Over 12 million slaves were estimated to have crossed the Atlantic to the Caribbean, Brazil, or southern United States. This is a form of forced Migration because the slaves had no choice but to go with the African raiders. Most slaves had no idea why they had to leave so they had no reason to make push or pull factors.\u000a\u000a2. WW2: When Hitler came to power in 1933, he began what many would call the Holocaust. In which the Nazi party began creating concentration camps to hold Jewish and enemy prisoners. Hitler began to force every Jewish family in Europe to migrate to these concentration camps to be either tortured or even murdered. The Jewish families were told if they did not cooperate they would be killed. many families tried to hide so many might suggest that this migration was voluntary, but if the family was caught trying to escape they would either be sent to camp or killed on the spot. Many families believed it would be a safer choice to just go with the Nazis than risk losing their entire family. Also if you did escape, you would be lost somewhere in Europe with nowhere to go and no idea if the Nazis would find you or not.

The short term goal is to grow a healthy culture of banana tissue in the laboratory in order to provide farmers with healthy bananas and potentially double the weight of a bunch. (Bananas are so disease and pest ridden because they are clones that are propagated by growing cuttings from suckers that sprout from the parent plant. Once one banana tree becomes diseased, all of its clones will be as well.)

sV52. Central Place Theory (Christaller)
p45997
VCentral Place Theory. Walter Christaller explained the patterns of urban land use in the central place theory. Just like von Thunen he assumed that the land was flat and uniform and transportation was equally distributed. Four main ideas: Central places are urban centers that provide services to the people in the hinterland (surrounding rural areas).\u000aThe more unique a function in a central place the higher its threshold (minimum number of people needed to validate a function's existence in the central place). The more unique a function (or good) in the central place the larger its range (maximum distance a person is willing to travel to obtain that service/good). Central places compete with each other because of spatial competition. Smaller central places will need to be located closer together because consumers are not willing to travel as far, but larger central areas are so important that distance is not as much of a factor. The urban hierarchy has levels with only a few cities at the top and more and more cities as you go down the list. The higher a city on the hierarchy the larger the population and the more variety of central place functions being serviced.

V. Distance decay is the idea that the further away an idea gets from its source, the less is known about it.

If a migrant in India hears about great opportunities of living in China and attempts to migrate there, and intervening obstacle could be the Himalayas, which would be life threatening to cross. The Himalayas are an example of an intervening obstacle, but that is an environmental obstacle. You could have an economic obstacle such as a town along the way may be in harsh poverty and you may not be able to continue migrating. Or a political obstacle: Migrating through a country that is ruled under a law that despises something about you like race, gender, culture, or personal status.

sV48. Profit Maximization (Losch's Zone of Maximization)
p47135
VAugust Lösch 1906-1945) was a German economist focused on market area analysis. According to Losch's Profit Maximization, the correct location of a firm lies where the net profit is greatest. It is difficult to pinpoint a single "best" location since it is possible to replace a declining amount of one input (labor) by another (automated technology) or increase transportation cost while reducing land rent ( Substitution Principle). With substitution, a number of different points may appear as optimal locations. Problems arise when a whole series of points exist where total revenue equals total cost (of producing a given output). The series of connected points is the Spatial Margin of Profitability -define the area within which profitable operation is possible. Location anywhere within the margin assures some profit. Includes spatial influence of consumer demand and production costs into his model. Losch's Assumptions: isotropic plain. Population evenly distributed. Identical preferences among population. Consumer paid cost of shipping product (as distance rose, so did cost). People acted economically rationally. New production plants could enter market if profitable.

VSummary: McDonald's buys more than 3.4 billion pounds of U.S. potatoes annually, and as such it has the power to dictate the potato industry. The company still relies heavily on the Russet-Burbank potato, despite how long is takes to mature, how much water it takes, and its propensity to fall prey to rots and diseases (which causes farmers to douse the potatoes in chemicals). Many socially conscious investors want McDonald's to consider other varieties of potatoes in order to cut pesticide usage and protect the environment. (A decade has passed since McDonald's last added a new U.S. potato variety to the three others approved for its fries.)
